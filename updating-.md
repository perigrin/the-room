# Updating ...
I've updated my friends list on use.perl to include more people I remember who's journals I actively try to read (beyond just Baud and Geoff) and it's made my friends-of-friends list rather long now ;)

Also darobin has added me as a friend which is as Death says "Peachy Keen".

I suppose this means I should get my act together, upload Bender to CPAN and start posting to use.perl semi-actively. Which is only more motivation to find/write the MT plugin to post cross-post to use.perl
