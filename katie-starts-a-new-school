Tomorrrow my baby starts a new school (her second since florida, and fourth ever ... not bad for a 4 year old. I can't wait till Highschool). She'll be attending, <a title="Central Florida Preparatory School - OpenGuides Orlando" href="http://openguide-orlando.prather.org/openguide.cgi?Central_Florida_Preparatory_School">Central Florida Preparatory School</a> (via OpenGuides Orlando). We went out last tuesday and bought her uniforms, and I had all kinds of flashbacks remembering exactly how much I disliked uniforms.
