# Today is a bank holiday
Today is a bank holiday for the Queen's Golden
Jubilee. It's been 25 years since the Sex Pistols
released God Save the Queen. Oh and I guess the
Queen has Reigned for 50 years, but I'm a Yank,
what do I care?

The BBC has been going through variations on the
theme "The History of the Queen." Last night was
"The history of the queen through Horses" which
basically boiled down to Katie telling me "I wanna
horse." The child is very two-ish.

Also I've put pictures
of Katie online again.
