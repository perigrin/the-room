# The Room Returns
So I've re-titled my blog back to it's original title, because it's returned to it's original URL. Dad has ideas on re-building the Prather.org website into a new fancy family wide thing, and since technically he owns it I'll support him in that. 

Mark's website should have returned, but I'll need to do some work there to help make sure the MT install is built properly. And I'm about to fix Rhonda's website (at least the files I can't access her template stuff instructions).

Welcome back to the Room. Don't mind the women with their talking of Michaelangelo.
