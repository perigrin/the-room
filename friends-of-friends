There is an article by Edd Dumbill entitled "<a title="XML Watch: Finding friends with XML and RDF" href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-foaf.html">XML Watch: Finding friends with XML and RDF</a>" which is about FOAF, or the Friend of a Friend application of RDF/XML.

RFD looks interesting, but hides itself well behind a cloak of graph theory mathmatics. At some point I want to peruse <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/w-rdf/?dwzone=xml">this intro</a> to RDF. I have a theory that SoqL can be used to query RDF which would be a neat application for it.

Ahh more ideas than time again. I enjoy this feeling more than a lack of ideas and plenty of time.
