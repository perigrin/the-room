This would be the first post from an upgraded instalation yeah! I can now write jsp pages if I wanted ... or PHP ... or mod_perl ... oh wait I do write mod_perl ...

We'll have to see what other goodies I get from it.  More explorations as we go along.

Also I have to upgrade Soq on this system this weekend, and luke's talking about the soq/Blog integration stuff.

It's all looking good to me.
