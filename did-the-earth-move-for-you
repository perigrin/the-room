So there was an earthquake
in Wolverhampton lastnight. 4.8 on the richter
scale, which is impressive when you realize that
alot of people don't even remember that Britain
exists on fault lines. And Edinburgh is built
around the remains of a volcano.
It also was strong enough to simulate a small
nuclear attack, which as Baud pointed out is scary
when you realize that it could have been
Birmingham.
