# Eoin's first typing Session
Eoin tonight started *reading* they keys off my keyboard to me. "Double" was the first one as he pointed to the `W`. After that we started pointing at keys and naming them, he did fairly well considering he's only just turned two (he was a little confused by left-brace `[` and right brace `]` ). While doing that he typed in the following:

<pre>
11       h
qqqqqqqqqqqqw22222222211q334444sd5555566666fd678ggg778ngvgg90ooi99900[=-=o0---opppppwwwww
</pre>


Not Shakespearean prose, but certainly worth preserving.
