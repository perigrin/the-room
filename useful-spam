Title: Useful SPAM?

So I got a pair of e-mails this morning that were obviously computer generated. Advertising an uptime service for my website. Obviously SPAM, as I've never registered for an Uptime service in my life (that I can remember).

However the approach was dfferent. "We noticed that the link [link] on the page [page] was returning a 404 and thought you should know." And the link on that page (and all my archive pages) was bad. I quickly went into the template for that bit of code and fixed it ... but I never would have found the bad link without the SPAM as the three readers I have don't give a whoot for my archives.

Useful SPAM who would have thought. They must be the exception that proves the rule.
