We have a new kitten. She's tiny, grey and very
very cute. I'll see about pictures when I can get
her to hold still, and perhaps when there's more
light for the web cam. We're trying to settle on a
name, so far the choices have been Neutron, Dora
(rejected by Kaite), and most recently Zelda. I'm
voting for Zelda, according to the baby name finder
it is "of Tutonic origin meaning gray haired
warrior heroine" which totally works. I suppose it
all depends upon Kaite tomorrow.
