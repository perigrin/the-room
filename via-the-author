# Via the Author
Neil Gaimen has spent alot of time talking to others about how he became a writer, what it means to write, and how others can do the same. I think one of the best pieces on writing I've seen from him thus far is his <a title="The Gaiman Archive / Literature: Waiting for the man" href="http://home.bip.net/rivieran/literature/reed.html">The interview with Lou Reed</a> [via Neil Gaimen]. It's ironic because the best pieces about writing are by Lou.
