# .mobi doesn't play
So there's a big debate about the upcoming .mobi domain. Linked from [#swig][1] today was:

Compare this to Tim Berners Lee's comments about the .mobi (and .xxx) domain.

Having thought about this I agree with Tim (surprise surprise). Here's how it breaks down for me. I own one third of the most popular prather.tld namespaces, the other two prather.net and prather.com are owned by a large corporation and a Washington DC lawyer respectively. Now Russel's solution would require the three of us to duke it out for *yet another* TLD just so we can support mobile devices. Who wins here?

Prather.net's owners are a large domain reseller, they make their business by selling of vanity subdomains of prather.net (yes rather like chris.prather.org, the irony is not lost on me) they are I believe backed by a Domain registrar. Meaning they'll *probably* get first whack at registering the domain, allowing them to provide a nifty service to their customers, "Pay 15 dollars more and get yournamehere.prather.mobi as well, and support Mobile Customers!" This screws me, and my DC Lawyer counter-part. The same way if either of us purchased this TLD we'd effectively screw the prather.net people. Do you see the disconnect here? 

One of the biggest phenomenon's of the net recently is Blogging and Wikis. A "true multi-party broadcast", blah blah blah, "lower barrier to entry", blah blah blah ... effectively anybody can create content, and their content is effectively equal (Except that it's not, I should rant on that later). What ICANN and by proxy Mr. Beattie are saying is that prather.net (or prather.com) because they have better resources and can acquire a .mobi domain have better content than I do. Or have content that will appeal more to .mobi users. Or something.

I hear you now, yes you Christy (I know it's you cause Jamie doesn't read this blog). Just shut up and buy a .mobi domain. But that's not the point. The point is someone is going to get effectively penalized because this "solution" doesn't solve shit, it places an arbitrary scarceness upon what has settled down into a market.

If you want to create a standard for mobile devices to know they can get mobile content the BY ALL MEANS DO SO. In http://www.example.com  the www generally signals web content. what's wrong with http://mobi.example.com to signal mobile content?
What's that you say? Nobody is required to serve content this way? Who's gonna stop me from serving DivX files of my cats on www.prather.mobi? (Other than the eventual owner of prather.mobi)? Oh there are standards. Phaw, there are HTML standards too, I can point to a *number* of sites that don't serve HTML 4.0 compliant content (let alone xhtml 1.1 strict). 

Have a peer program, do some advertising. Get the phone manufacturers to support it and I bet you people will do it. Heck use a certification program, large companies *love* certification programs. This is what's really gonna be the enforcement in a .mobi domain.

I've had a nice long rant now, I bet when I look back on this post in 5 years I wonder what ever happened to the .mobi domain. My honest prediction is it won't do what Mr. Beattie is wanting, and it won't cause the havoc that Mr. Lee fears.
