We are getting a <a href="http://www.prather.org/~rowland/">Rhonda</a> tonight as a guest. 

She works for a big company that pays for her to take a big airplane to the UK to work. I work for a small company that doesn't pay for me to take a big airplane to the UK to work ... they expect me to just take the bus in the morning like everybody else.

But, this weekend sounds like it's full of touristy plans. We may check out the finer Scottish Dining cuisine (According to <a href="http://use.perl.org/~matts">Baud</a> Dubh Prais is good) ... and there's an easter egg hunt on Saturday at the castle.

We shall see what goes on where.
