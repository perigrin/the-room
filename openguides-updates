Thanks to [Christopher Schmidt][1] the [OpenGuide to the Twin Cities][2] has had some recent upgrades. Chris runs the [Boston OpenGuide][3] and has done some serious hackage on that guide to improve usability etc.

I've imported a few of his hacks into the [Twin City Guide][2] to make my life easier and to see about drumming up more people who actually use it. I think we're about to hit a tipping point, and people might actually start finding it useful.

So tonight, I've gone through and fixed all the church entries I scraped off Planet99, I added City, and Long/Lat metadata to all of them which made the google maps stuff come alive on all of those pages. I have also gone through and updated some of the templates and underlying code to make patching future things easier ... new categories will automatically get @MAP\_LINK and @INDEX\_LIST added to them. And if a node has no content, it will now politely prompt the viewer to edit it and add some.

All this and the [Victora, BC Guide][4] gets the additions for Free! W00t
