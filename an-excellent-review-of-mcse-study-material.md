# An Excellent Review of MCSE Study Material
<a title="Amazon.co.uk: Books: MCSE Self Paced Training Kit: Windows Server 2003 Core Requirements" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735619530/qid%3D1110380203/sr%3D8-5/ref%3Dpd%5Fka%5F4/026-9312509-8634016">Amazon.co.uk: Books: MCSE Self Paced Training Kit: Windows Server 2003 Core Requirements</a>

<blockquote>"I read these four books in under five hours having just got back from a week long, round-the-world, drugs and alcohol bender before finally hitting the sack. I managed to sit all four of the exams while being completely unconsious and passed all of them with an average score of 900. This only goes to highlight the sheer quality of this package, I advise anyone looking to pass their MS cert's to go ahead and buy these books immediately."</blockquote>
