# Google is Self Aware...
<a title="Google Search: define:google" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&q=define%3Agoogle&btnG=Search">Google Search: define:google</a>

So I went to lookup a definiton for a word, and google presented me with one of it's new tools "define:" searches.  This is I think one of the best tools google has provided me yet, it presents so many possiblities.

You can have a hypertext version of a story, and link the large words to like <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&q=define%3AConjunctiva&btnG=Search">Conjunctiva</a>
and instantly get a list of definitons from places where it's used. You could link in <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&q=define%3Acommon&btnG=Search">common</a> terms that you thought you knew, but find new meanings to them. 

It makes textual analysis that much easier. Think of the possibilities.
