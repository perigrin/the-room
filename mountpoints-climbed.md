# Mountpoints Climbed
Worked like a champ. Now I can copy mp3's to the palm by simply sticking the right media in the right drive and typing:

<code>cp /mnt/cdrom/pina_colada_song.mp3 /mnt/sdcard/Audio</code>

This also works with text files from Vi, WordDocs and SpreadSheets from OpenOffice, and HTML Files for the Palm's WebBrowser. All in all I'm chuffed.
