# Enhanced Smoking Techniques for Saving My Ass

*In which we learn how a cockup can re-inforce lessons about money, and help provide some new infrastructure for Perl5 Core*

## The Background

If you were at YAPC::NA this past summer[^1] you might have attended [my talk][1] about my company Tamarou. One of the points I tried making about the talk was to understand the important of money. One of the points I tried to get across is that Money is not a finite substance (like we treat it metaphorical house hold budgets), but a fluid (like people who properly operate with money treat it). Anyone who has seen the talk may also have noticed that I was a little tired[^2]. This is mainly because I had forgotten the this point *myself* and was trying to pull some heroics to unstick a project that had gotten firmly stuck.

I really don't want to go into the details on what went wrong. There is plenty of blame to go around, but the situation is that it screwed up our cashflows horribly. It also wrecked me for a couple months[^3]. Which lead us to the situation we're in now. Tamarou needs some help with our cashflow. We have contracts coming in that will help us in the coming months, but we have more serious short term needs and rather than just begging for money we decided we'd rather give something to the Perl community. 

## The Plan

Back in March there was a discussion, which I participated in, on the Perl5 Porters mailing list. The outcome of this discussion was that despite the amazing efforts by people like Steffen MÃ¼ller, Abe Timmerman, George Greer, Andreas Koenig, and others I'm totally forgetting I'm sure; there is room for more better smoking infrastructure for the Perl core. Nicholas Clark even went so far as to sketch out some notes on what he would like to see. Shortly after this email thread happened, I started my ill fated summer project.

However times have changed, and as we said Tamarou desperately needs to trade some time for money. So we've started [a project][2] on the new and improved [tamarou website][3]. The project has the general outline of what I think needs to be done to accomplish the tasks that Nicholas defined. It has a timeline for how long I expect to do it. It also has a place where if you want you can donate some money to making this project happen. We need about $5000 dollars to make this work.

## Questions

1) Why not get a grant from The Perl Foundation?

I love The Perl Foundation. I will try to do anything that Karen Pauly, the TPF president asks, because I think she works far too hard as it is. That said I think that the TPF has had a rocky history when it comes to development grants. I think that the Perl5 Core Maintenance fund is doing an awesome job is moving past that history, but I wanted to try something different. I'm still open to TPF involvement, I just think that Tamarou can show a third way to do crowd sourced funding for Perl development.

2) What happens if you fail?

Then we fail. Publically. I think that the scope is well understood enough that it can be reasonably accomplished on the timemline I've given it. If I go over then I go over. If it cannot be accomplisehd then however far I get will be committed to a public repository and provided for the world to use. 

3) Is this really something we need?

I don't know. In March people were happy to see it done. I've talked with some of the people it would directly benefit and they didn't seem to think the project was insane. I had to pick *something* to try, this is what I picked. If you have a better idea, and this experiment doesn't totally blow up in our face ... we can try your idea next time!

3) How can I help?

Well one you can donate money. We can really use the cash. Two, there are many many tasks I left out of the initial scope of this project to make something I thought could be reasonably accomplished on a reasonable schedule and budget.

5) Did people really ask you these questions?

No. I just made them up. But they were real questions I had when I thought about this project and why the hell someone would want to fund it.

[^2]: My favorite comment/review of the talk was "Dude needs a nap." I forget who made the comment at this point but it was awesome.
[^3]: One of the best things, for me, to come out of the Moving to Moose hackathon was it reminded me of all the things I love about the Perl community.
