<a title="Home - Open Guide to St. Paul" href="http://saintpaul.openguides.org/index.cgi">Home - Open Guide to St. Paul</a> has been generously upgraded. The database is now running on a quad-proc <strike>xenon</strike> Xeon, and the application is running inside mod_perl.

Also the blogs have been moved onto this same database, as was <a href="http://dahut.pm.org">The Dahut.pm Website</a>

Edit: Personally I prefer intert gas for my servers, but I've corrected the spelling above.
