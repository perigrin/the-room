# Go CT!
<a title="Chris Thompson" href="http://cthompson.com/entries/2003/03/15/">Chris Thompson</a> got himself discussed on xml-dev for the linked post. Aparently there was a world of discussion about someone actually doing the right thing when it comes to web design.

I'm not sure which is more depressing that it generated alot of discussion, or that it's not as common as it should be in the world.

Either way, CT has done everything I believe you >should< do in a website and done it with style. Congrats CT.
