So I added a new little green button to the bottom of the page (you might have noticed it). It links to GeoURL which resolves blogs to real world coordinates. I wasn't sure if I liked the idea or not but I've thought about it a whole lot and decided yes, I do like the idea for may varied reasons which I will explain later.

However back to the point, clicking the GeoURL brings up a list of spatially local blogs to Me. At least those who've registered with GeoURL. One of those is <a title="The Flat At The Top Of The Stairs" href="http://www.joannou.net/topofthestairs/">The Flat At The Top Of The Stairs</a> which lead me to <a href="http://www.gm009a5328.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/scotsblogs/">A list of Scottish Blogs</a> which is kinda cool.  It's like wandering through people's gardens sort of randomly.
