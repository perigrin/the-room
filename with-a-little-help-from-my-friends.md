# With a Little Help From My Friends

So I haven't blogged much in the last month. Now I blog twice in one
evening[^1]. I've been incredibly busy on something that it turns out is
the topic for this post.

Today coming across the Iron Man feed was G치bor Szab칩's post about
["Cooperation among Perl freelancers"][2]. This hit pretty close to home for
me since last September or so I started working full time for 
[my own company][1], which is at this stage operating as a small Perl consultancy.

I've spent the last six months (when I wasn't working on client code)
learning as much as I could about freelancing, consulting, and running a
business in general[^2]. I can fully appreciate what G치bor is talking
about when it comes to fluctuating demand. The problem of scalability
he's pointing too happens to larger businesses as well as smaller ones.
It seems that either you have too much work, or not enough, never
in between.

One of the common refrains I heard at my last job was how hard it was to
find good Perl talent, which always struck me as odd when I hear from
people how hard it is to find a good Perl job. As a consultancy it
seemed to me I would be in an ideal position to bridge that gap. I
participate in the community, I (generally) know when what I consider
good Perl talent is available. I've been lucky a few times and have been
informed when a good Perl job is available, and have been able to match
people up. 

Often however the problem isn't that the talent and the jobs aren't
available, it's that they're not available in the same place or at
exactly the right times. One of Tamarou's contracts is with a company
that for business reasons cannot hire telecommuters directly. We solve
that problem for them. This is I believe what `mst` called a [dev shop][3].

If you haven't already read `mst`'s blog about it go do that now. I'll
wait. Done? Did you read the [post he linked to][4]? No? Go read that
too. Good. I've been reading and thinking about stuff like this for the
last year[^3], and all of the stories are roughly the same. Hiring a
freelancer or a consultant isn't easy. The rules are the same as hiring
in house. They need to be high quality, professional, and a good fit
with your company's goals and fill the places you're missing perfectly.

Not all consultancies are created equal either, Shadowcat are a very
technically sophisticated company. They know Catalyst, DBIx::Class, and
Perl intimately. At Tamarou we're focusing on embedding people to really
learn your business domain. Different approaches because we're different
companies, and you know what ... at some point I will say to a client of
mine that we really need to hire Shadowcat to solve some problem we're
having, I hope Shadowcat will do the same.

This is I think where the power of G치bor's idea is. Figuring out as a
community where our skills lie, and helping each other find the best fit
to solve our problems. We need to as a community talk about what we need
and expect from each other and helping each other find the right fit.
I'm not quite sure what form this should take, except I've recently
started building a list of Dev Shops, Consultancies and Freelancers in
the Perl space, I welcome people adding to [the list][5].

[^1]: You can tell it's the same evening because apparently I'm
recycling Beatles songs for post titles. I swear I'm not even listening
to the Beatles right now.

[^2]: Which is convient as my wife has had her own 
[small business](http://superawesomecool.org) explode with activity in the last month.

[^3]: I'm planning on looking, reading, and doing stuff like this for at
least the next ten years. That's how long it took me to be confident
enough at Perl to consider myself good with Perl.
