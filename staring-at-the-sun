# Staring at the Sun
<a title="Sun Java System Web Server 6.1" href="http://www.sun.com/software/products/web_srvr/faqs.xml">Sun Java System Web Server 6.1</a>
<blockquote>
Q:
Why not just use the free Apache Web server?
A:
While Apache is a great general purpose Web server, it lacks the security, support, and testing requirements typically required in the deployment of enterprise Web applications. The Java System Web Server goes through extensive security reviews, is fully supported by Sun and its worldwide network of iForce partners, and goes through full testing cycles, which test not only the core content engines, but also the add-on components.
