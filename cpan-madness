So I just released 3 CPAN packages (MooseX:Storage (new to me), Moose:Tiny (silly), and JSON:Any 1.09 (utf8 fun!)) and I'm feeling very satisfied. I've also been working on getting Cogwheel fleshed out to be released, and playing with Hiveminder (http://hiveminder.com/) for a TODO list maker. I have to say I'm impressed with Hiveminder so far.
