# Linux
Well I've managed to get enough linux installed on the laptop that I can (obviously) get online. Though I am using lynx as a web browser at the moment. X (with KDE) is installing as we speak, hopefully I can get Firebird (Mozilla's browser only) and XChat and other goodies working when it's finished. After that it'll be time to figure out how to get the wireless card working (gotta buy a wireless adaptor for the desktop) and then other goodies like sound and perhaps a better screen size (this doesn't seem to be using all of my 800x600 screen) 
Yes this is yet another geekish post. But I don't really care now do I?
