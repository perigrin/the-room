# For the love of a wife...
Jamie had a craving.  She wanted me to drive to [Key's Cafe][1] and buy her Snickerdoodles. When I refused she decided we should make them. The recipe below is from [Cooks.com][2]

SNICKERDOODLES
--------------

* 2 eggs
* 2/3 cup oil
* 2 tsp. vanilla
* 3/4 cup sugar
* 2 cups flour, sifted
* 2 t. baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1 tsp cinnamon or 2 tsp grated lemon rind
* 1/2 cup sugar

Heat oven to 400.

Beat eggs with fork, stir in oil, vanilla and lemon rind (if using). Blend in 3/4 cup sugar until mixture thickens.

Blend flour, baking powder, and salt; add to mixture.

Roll into 1 inch balls. Mix 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon. Roll balls in sugar mixture.

Place on baking sheet, criss cross with fork. Place 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheet.

Bake 8-10 minutes. Remove immediately from baking sheet.

Variations: You may omit cinnamon and use 2 tsp lemon rind in batter, roll in sugar and bake.
