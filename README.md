# The Room
My blog started sometime at the turn of the century. What a phrase right? Basically it started as a way for me to participate in online culture. Over the years it was used as testbed for software I worked on, as a way to talk about tools I'd been working with, and as a way to communicate with the communities I was involved with (mostly Perl).
