Started reading Techgnosis by Erick Davis again
last night. (Even managed to pick up where I'd left
off ... over a year ago ... the book is that dense)
and it gave me some great ideas surrounding
Technology/Mysticism that explain the common
archtypes found in alot of the Cyperpunkish books
I've read. Try reading both The Wonderland Gambit
by Jack Chalker, and Donnerjack by Rodger Zelany.
Both are amazing. In a similar vein is Lord of
Light by Zelany (and probably stylistically closer
to the Technological Sublime). I promise the posts
full of literary techno-babble will be few and far
between. (Least after I finish reading Techgnosis
... until the consider yourself warned)
