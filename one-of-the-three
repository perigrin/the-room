# One of the three
Right, so perhaps some gentle egging can keep
Christy posting. I read her blog, more often it
seems than I talk to her. So I'm one of the three.
I'm no better at keeping things up to date than she
is. For me it's a motivation thing, I'm either not
at my computer when I want to write something (and
I haven't gotten my Palm setup to blog from it yet
... used to, doesn't now.) or I am but I'm busy
doing something else that I can't be bothered to
take the time to huntdown a way of adding a
posting.

I manually update the pages myself. I don't (yet)
use MoveableType or Blogger or any other blogging
software. I use Soq which is the product I'm a
developer on, but sometimes it's hard to find a
working demo (cause I break mine more often than
not developing on it) that has permission to write
to prather.org ...

I want to take a look at writing an application
that will take let me post in the least intensive
fashion possible. Does anybody have any
reccomendations? I'd also like to have it do RSS
feeds, and some other nice features if possible.

I've thought about going with Moveable Type, it's
popular right now, written in Perl (always a
bonus) and does 90% of what I want. It just doesn't
deal well with Soq (currently). I may look at
trying to write a Squid (Soq Plugin) to work with
Moveable Type. Actually I quite like that idea.
