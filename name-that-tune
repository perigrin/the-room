    "I HATE YOU"

    Lyrics by Kirk R. Thatcher
    Music by Mark Mangini


(to be sung Allegro con Temptible)


    Just what is the future?
    The things we've done and said.
    Let's just push the button.
    We'd be better off dead!

    And I hate you!
    and I berate you !
    and I can't wait to get to you...

    The sins of all the fathers,
    being dumped on us â€“ the sons
    The only choice we're given is:
    How many megatons?

    So I eschew you!
    And I say "SCREW YOU"!
    And I hope you're blue too!

    We're all bloody worthless,
    Just greedy human scum,
    The numbers all add up
    to a negative sum...

    And I hate you!
    And I hate you!
    And I hate you...too!
