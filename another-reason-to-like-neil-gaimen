So there is yet another reason in my books why I enjoy the many many works of Mr. Gaimen. We share our favorite place on earth.

(Talking about shooting beginnging for the film version of Stardust)
>It starts shooting on location in Skye next week. I don't know if having the multitudinous readers of a blog concentrate on making sure the weather in Skye is as unseasonably clear, warm and sunny as possible starting next Wednesday will do any good, but it couldn't hurt. (I won't be there, alas, although Skye is possibly my favourite place in the world, whatever the weather.)
