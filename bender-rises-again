<a title="Bite My Shiny Metal Ass!" href="http://bender.prather.org/">Bender</a> has working Blogger code again (not that this really means much). And he seems to be heavily used by the #YAPC people (YAPC::NA currently is happening in Boca Raton) as an OpBot. 

This only means that Rhonda was probably right. The alter-ego for my Bot has a better Perl life than I do.
