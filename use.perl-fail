Today I was reading a use.perl journal and ended up on the homepage and saw this:

<div class="thumbnail"><a href="http://skitch.com/perigrin/bpmai/use.perl-fail"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20090428-mh2yahft2fsf8ppk1rtf9p195n.preview.jpg" alt="use.perl FAIL" /></a><br /><span style="font-family: Lucida Grande, Trebuchet, sans-serif, Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 10px; color: #808080">Uploaded with <a href="http://plasq.com/">plasq</a>'s <a href="http://skitch.com">Skitch</a>!</span></div>

FAIL.

According to mst I need to hunt down rafael, davorg, grinder, <tt>brian d foy</tt> or pudge to see if I can be added to the list of people who are responsible for making sure that doesn't happen. I suck at this kind of stuff, but we can't let one of the main perl news sites go blank like that, it just looks bad.  Is there someone out there who's better able to volunteer to do this than I am?
