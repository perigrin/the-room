I've done a fair bit of spring cleaning tonight. I tried to clean up the referrer log, we'll see if I have when awstats rebuilds it. I also removed Mark's blog, as he says he'll not be using it anytime soon.

Next I'll try to resolve the 404s and see if I can get my name unsullied in the annals of Google. The robots.txt file I created tonight should help with that a bit. As has the hack and slash I did a while back on the comments.

All in all I think I've got a good start again on things. We'll see where we go from here.
