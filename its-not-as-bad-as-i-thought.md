# It's not as bad as I thought...
Of the 154 posts on this site ... only 14 refer directly to Perl. At least according to Google.

That's not nearly as bad as even I thought it would be. I can cope with that. It does however prove that I am a geek (not that proof was needed).

We shall see where this leads.  I need more hobbies.
