# Usefulness
So I had promised to provide links to stuff when someone asked last night on the phone. I was gonna link to the BaroqueCycle.com but <a title="Main Page - Metaweb" href="http://www.metaweb.com/wiki/wiki.phtml">this</a> was much more interesting.

I also promised a link to the article about the <a  href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/01/09/survey.html">Future of Perl</a>. 

If I remember the other links, or I'm reminded of the other links, I'll post them too.
