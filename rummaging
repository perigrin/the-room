# Rummaging...
So rummaging about looking up information on all the things I've wanted to do, I found <a title="Charlie's Tidy Add-ons" href="http://users.rcn.com/creitzel/tidy.html#tidyperl">HTML::Tidy</a>  a SWIG based Perl/Tidy interface. I wonder why it's not on CPAN (it does however mean I can look at writing Apache::Tidy).

I also found some neat aritlces on XML.COM one talking about embedding <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/02/05/tr.html">Javscript into XSLT</a> and one talking about using XSLT as an <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/01/02/tr.html">RSS aggregator</a>. Both would be useful if either 1) the browser side XSLT engines were "there" as far as compleatness ... or 2) I had an <a href="http://www.axkit.org/">AxKit</a> server still.

::sigh::
