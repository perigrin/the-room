# Because some people complained...
After two days of simple hackery, I've added a bit of something to help people who have been complaining about the color scheme here at prather.org. You can now, <a title="Customize Site Colors" href="http://www.prather.org/customize.html">Customize Site Colors</a> till your heart's content. The color choices are stored in a cookie and persist every time you visit the site.

Enjoy.
