More hubris than the original author has to this day. Really if we were being descriptive of the original intent Task::StopMstFromWhinging would have been it's name, and that wouldn't have been any better.

From a historical perspective Task::Kensho came from the time when modules were being named things like Moose, Catalyst, and Starman. Specifically it predates the "awesome" github repositories that were all the rage for a while (specifically [awesome-perl](https://github.com/hachiojipm/awesome-perl)[^1] It probably would have been that had those been a thing when Task::Kensho was written. Which sorta is a theme in Perl space. A lot of our weirdness is because we tried things before they were popular elsewhere. And the elsewheres never bothered to ask us our opinions when they became popular.

It came at a time when Task:: modules were being created. It was originally a default install of clear choices. But slowly as time went on people recommended (and rightly so) mutually alternative choices, and we didn't have a space to discuss which choice should be the *default*. Maybe we have that space now in Github tickets.

I like having Task::Kensho on CPAN because CPAN is Perl. Other languages have embraced github in beautiful ways (I'm looking at you go with `import "github.com/foo/bar"), and that's great for them. But CPAN is where Perl does it's thing, for better or worse[^2]. I like having Task::Kensho just be something you just run with `cpanm -i Task::Kensho` and start making the choices.

1: The first CPAN release of Task::Kensho is only 7 months after Github was founded according to Wikipedia.

2: Trust me I have my complaints about CPAN, and Perl modules, and our tool-chain. But they're things that we as Perl developers have to live with. I have more respect for the languages that explain their idiosyncratic tool-chains than the ones that try to protect me, the newbie, from their crazy legacy choices.
