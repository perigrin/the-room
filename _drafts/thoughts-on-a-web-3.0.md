## A Vision Thing

I was sitting here reading [Matt Baer’s Web 3.0
article](https://write.as/matt/what-would-a-real-web3-look-like) and I agree
with everything he says. It meshes well with @robin@mastodon.social’s  [opus on
institutional capacity](https://berjon.com/internet-transition/) (though
Robin’s piece hits far wider and deeper than just the web, and touches on
post-colonialism as well so much more). The FediVerse reminds me strongly of
the Web 1.0 era when Blogs proamed the web, and people were just trying to
figure out how it all worked.

Baer's main points about Web 3.0 are:
* It gives users as much control over their data as possible
* It lets users choose who controls their data
* It promotes standards over implementations
* It prefers minimal data collection

Basically it's more transparent, local, and consent based than the capitalism
driven Web 2.0 silos.

The bullet point I think Baer missed in his vision though is the reason Web 1.0 evolved into Web 2.0 for a reason: sustainability.

## Sustainability

The [Mastodon Server Covenant](https://joinmastodon.org/covenant) requires that servers have:
* Active moderation against racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia
* Daily backups
* At least one other person with emergency access to the server infrastructure
* Commitment to give users at least 3 months of advance warning in case of shutting down

In other words, most servers need to have enough sustainability to at least
wind down cleanly. Also note that these points don't cover any of the other
issues with running a website with user generated content  [that people have
pointed out](https://denise.dreamwidth.org/91757.html). And that first bullet
point alone could be a full time job, with a  [high burnout
rate](https://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/the-human-cost-of-online-content-moderation).

Most ActivityPub instances are:
* volunteer run,
* run by non-profits,
* or run by businesses reportedly at a loss.

Companies (like [FT
Alphaville](https://fediversereport.com/experiment-over-ft-alphaville-shuts-down-mastodon-instance))
cite the non-technical expenses of running an instance.

Having spent 20+ years working with open source, volunteer based organizations,
and small to medium businesses: sustainability is the last consideration most
people have. This is how Web 2.0 happened in the first place.

## Picture it, The Web ... 2004

The cost of running a popular web site was larger than an individual or even a
small group could handle. Especially at scale.

The costs self-hosting were rarely directly visible. The hosting, even in the
early 2000s, was rarely a problem. The amount of time it took to maintain a
platform though, that wasn’t zero. It went up *rapidly* if you added traffic.
Slashdotting, The Reddit Effect, the Hug of Death, if you had something go
viral you could find yourself offline, or buying your hosting company a new
yacht.

There is always money available to make a business out of success … and lots of
groups would form a business without really thinking about how to translate
success into money. Since nobody knew how to make money, valuations were based
on user adoption.

You optimize to get as many people onboard as quickly as possible and figure
out how to monetize them later. Eventually if you were lucky someone would buy
you before you had to figure it out, or you would IPO before the market figured
you out. Repeat this process for about a decade and it’s how you get from
Movable Type and Live Journal to Twitter and Facebook.

All of these pressures that lead to the big silos of Web 2.0 haven’t really
gone away, though we have mostly learned to focus on revenue rather than user
share. Mostly.

The ever increasing churn of startups has reduced the cost of starting up a
business though. The capital costs could be as low as zero. Sweat equity though
hasn’t gone to zero. And it certainly isn't zero when that side hustle starts
succeeding too quickly or failing too spectacularly.

Venture Capitalists will always be there with money to help out. They are maybe
more discerning now that there are safer (for them) ways of investing. But
there will always be someone ready to give a small startup showing signs of
success the money it needs to the next stage … for a cut of the outcome. Some
help is better than others, but you’ve just added pressure to not only cover
your costs (average spend for a household in the US is purportedly just over
$61,000 … or $30/hr) but the costs of your new partners as well. I've heard
that traditionally investors want a 10x return on their investment: a million
for every hundred thousand they give you. They also usually don’t want that
money spread out over the lifespan of a privately held company, but rather in
one big event … either a sale or an IPO. So unless you can raise enough to buy
them out, you get to be one of the big corporations that made Web 2.0 what it
is today.

## We Need to Change

In order to stave off a repeat of web 2.0, we need more ways to sustainably
finance our infrastructure, and more specifically the teams behind them.

Without allowing people to be independent economically we haven’t really gotten
past corporate media control, we’ve just hidden it a layer deeper. We will just
have big silos in the form of Kickstarter, Patreon, Stripe, and the other big
players already behind the "content creator" industry.

We need ways to reduce the risks involved. The risks of hobby projects suddenly
becoming more than a hobby, but also  the risks of trading time and services
for money on the open market. Self employment costs 15% more than having an
office job, and that's without benefits like heavily subsidized healthcare (the
ACA is amzing, but it's not evenly distributed and in this industry it's not as
good as employer subsidized insurance).

We need something that reinforces autonomy but enables sustainability of the
underlying infrastructure.

## Listeners like You

Public Radio funding breaks down like this (or at least NPR): Corporate
Sponsors, Fees from Content, Contributions, Service fees for infrastructure
(satellite interconnects etc.), Endowments, Ivestments, Other

That second item, fees from content, that’s money coming from local stations to
pay for the shows. Member stations get the plurality of their revenue (43%)
from listeners.

Something like this system could possibly work for the FediVerse, with each
instance picking a different mix of funding sources.

Users contribute to instances, Instance should make sure to contribute back to
the projects that they depend on to work, servers, clients, etc.

Instances would also contribute to an organization that would be able to take
over and wind down an instance if it’s maintainers can’t keep things going.

## Return to the Ordinary World

This is one example of a system of autonomous collectives, there are many other
ways to go about this process. The important part isn’t how we cover
sustainable funding, but to be sure that we include it as part of the
conversation about the future of Web 3.0.

I'm hoping that places like hachyderm.io, treehouse.social, even
mastodon.social prove to be the rule rather than the exceptions.
