Title: Looking for some space?

So, if you're looking for some hosting for your weblog, and you happen to read mine perhaps we can make a deal. I can't afford to keep the new server unless the people who are currently using it (if you don't know who you are I'll e-mail you) and perhaps a few others help chip in to defray the costs.

Doing the maths, it looks like for about $10/mo from each of us we can have as much space and power as we've ever wanted, totally ad free. Plus any perl based CGI scripts anyone wants included (or custom written when I've got a chance ... like a request I've already had for a comments script).

Please drop me a line if you're interested.
