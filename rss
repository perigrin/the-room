Title: RSS

First I found:

<a title="Planet Perl" href="http://planet.perl.org/">Planet Perl</a>

Which takes out a good number of the links I read from the side panel (Dan and Baud are both in there, as are a number of other Perl people)

And that linked me to:

<a title="Amazon.com Syndicated Content" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/subst/xs/syndicate.html/002-7484962-6282460">Amazon.com Syndicated Content</a>

Which really this simply means that I need to get some form of RSS aggregator working on my behalf, because the world is making life much more convient for RSS consumers than it is for web consumers.

What would be best would be for it to output RSS to my palm.
