So Jamie had pumped some more milk for Eoin (the new baby ... pronounced Owen) so we drove it down to the hospital at around midnight. I decided to wait in the car while she just ran in quickly to drop it off so I could listen to the radio. While sitting there I heard a loud screech and looked up and saw a pickup smack into a tree in front of me at about 30 mph. I was even the first person on the scene! While he has what looks like a nasty head wound I think the guy was too drunk to be injured seriously. As I was the only actual person to see the truck hit the tree I had to give my name and number to the police. Excitement excitement.
