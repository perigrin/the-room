# The Open Guide to Dahut.pm
So I've gone and setup the new [dahut.pm.org][1] and this time we're using a wiki, [OpenGuides][2] to be specific. I went with OpenGuides cause it seems a nice fit for the dahut.pm community. Really this is a chance to try and build something of a community out of a group of people who are silently pursuing semi-related pursuits, and I think there's a good chance something could come of it.

We'll have to see.
