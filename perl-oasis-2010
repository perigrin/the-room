Title: Perl Oasis 2010
Date: 2009-11-02 01:56

So things are settled for 2010 Perl Oasis, I'm just waiting for
instructions on what needs to be done to enable the website. The date is
confirmed, January 16, 2010. The venue this year is the [Four Points
Sheraton Orlando][1], which is *much* closer to the action.

A note on the special rate for the hotel:

	All reservations must be received on or before November 25, 2009. They
	will release all rooms after this date, rooms must be prepaid or they
	are lost.

	Hotel dates Jan 15-18 for the $75 rate, I think they will add a few
	days on either side.

	Hotel Reservations Department at 1-800-327-1366 between the hours of
	9AM - 6PM (EST I assume), Monday through Friday only

So if you're going to be staying at the venue you need to reserve
quickly. There are however plenty of other options nearby too.

As soon as the website is up we'll throw open a call for speakers, but
we've had some speakers already agree to participate. Mark Keating from
the [Enlightened Perl Organisation][2] will be giving the keynote. He
has said he will be bringing along Matt Trout for moral support. From
the other end of the world, [Karen][3] and Marty Pauly will be coming
from Japan(!!) and I hope to arm twist one or both of them into
speaking.

This is shaping up to be a gangbuster of a workshop, and I am wildly
excited by everything that is going on.
