A friend of mine, Mike, created <a title="" href="http://nachbaur.com/resources/Fetch.pm">a script</a> that proxies George Bush's website through his own.

The script isn't technically very challenging. The interesting piece is another Friend (Kjetil) posted a link to the script to /. and gave it a decently politicized description.  Let's see if the slavoring hordes at /. devour Mike's poor server.
