Title: Redland Gentoo Love

So I have managed to build a set of <a href="http://chris.prather.org/projects/redland-snapshot.tar.gz">ebuilds</a> for the latest snapshots of Redland. Basically I just updated the ebuilds from portage to point at the snapshot files, and renamed them. I had to tinker a bit with the ebuild for Redland Bindings. The distributed configure.ac didn't like the new Redland version number (1.0.1) when compared with the current version number (1.0.0.3) ...

I suspect I'll probably post a bug to the dev list too or something.
