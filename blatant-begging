Title: Blatant Begging

So the time has come where I scurry and do some last minute organization for [Perl Oasis](http://perloasis.com). Last year was very small because I wasn't very organized in advertising it, and this year I hope to do better but the first hurdle is fund raising. Last year we had *amazing* support from [HD Publishing Group](http://hdpublishinggroup.com) a local Perl company. They simply cannot promise the same level of support this year, and after the support they provided last year I cannot rightly blame them.

The Budget for the entire 2009 workshop was under $2,500 and considering the price of admission we  charged was less than 10% of [NoSQL-East](http://nosqleast.com/2009/) we were a bargain! Now I could go to all the same people who sponsor Perl workshops and YAPCs and what not (and if those people wanna contact me I'm happy to speak with them) but I *really* would like to speak to new companies who might be put off by the expense of a large national conference. Since we're trying to make this year's budget more affordable than last year this is a perfect year for a small business to step in and donate $100, $500 or $1000 and make a *huge* difference.

So this is where the unabashed begging comes in. I need everybody to reach out in their community and ask someone if they would like to sponsor a single day of celebrating the Modern Perl Enlightenment.
