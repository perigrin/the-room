# Lost...
Well I lost everything that was on this front page.
I was testing something in Soq and accidentally
over-wrote the index.html file with a blank file.
Oops.

I have tried to rebuild as best as possible, but
the posts only existed here at the moment, and thus
are lost forever.

Is the color too much? Yes I think it is.

If you weren't fast enough you didn't get to see
it. Sorry.
