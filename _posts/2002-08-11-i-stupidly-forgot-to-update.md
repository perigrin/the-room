# I stupidly forgot to update...
I stupidly forgot to update the page just a second
ago and lost the previous post. I suppose this is
why people use blogging software. I really should
get my ass in gear and write that blogging software
I wanna write.

The good thing is I had nothing important to say
before. So it's not like you all are missing
anything important.

::time passes::

So the question arises, am I lazy, or inventive? I
spent several hours tonight writting an application
to change the mp3's playing on a different machine
on the network because I didn't want to have to
getup, walk across the room, and push a button.

This is the same problem that caused the invention
of the remote control. And Lazy is one of the
attributes of a good programmer.

Of course silly me, I gave my kid brother the URL
for the app (yes I wrote as a mod_perl handler,
have you got a problem wtih that?) and he spent the
next hour f***ing with the songs. ::sigh::
