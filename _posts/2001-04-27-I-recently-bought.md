Hi,

I recently bought Prather.org, and I hope to make this the virtual home for Prather family research. What is Prather Family Research? Well that all depends on the Prather family I suppose.

I hope to put up a family tree system in the near future, to allow those out there who are interested to post geneology information and share with others.

I've also considered opening up the e-mail addresses to those who would like an e-mail account with their last name.

I may also let people grab sub-domains for non-profit projects.

The only rule is it has to be Prather related.

Either by Prathers or about Prathers.

If you are a Prather and you'd like to comment or help out, feel free to contact me. I could use all the help I can get.

Thanks,
Chris
