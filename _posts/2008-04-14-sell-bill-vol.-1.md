# Sell Bill Vol. 1
So I'm [selling my car][1]. It's been a good car for the last 4 years, and still runs like a horse. This will be the second time in my adult life I've been without a car, but the last time I was living in the UK where they have excellent public transportation. 

Good luck Bill (the car's name), enjoy your future where ever it is.
