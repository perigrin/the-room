# Power to the Peeps

> ST. PAUL â€” Marshmallow Peeps have been multiplying outside City Hall as a symbol of protest over last week's decision to evict the Easter Bunny.

> A handful of employees have placed the spongy chick- and rabbit-shaped candies around a City Hall statue of American Indians, along with two signs that temporarily rename the "Vision of Peace" statue as the "Vision of Peeps."

I would really like to get past the Capitol and get a picture of that before it's gone.
