# Is it so terrible?
So I've written a little application that will allow my IRC <a title="Bite My Shiny Metal Ass!" href="http://bender.prather.org/">Bot to blog</a> for me (and anybody else who happens to be in the same channel as he is).

I keep claiming it's sick. My friends tell me I have no idea. But then I'm not alone, I happen to know of at least three other blogging Bots on IRC. So really is it that terrible?

I'm trying to decide how it might be useful. So far I can imagine using it to keep track of things like Post-it notes while having a conversation on IRC. This really only makes me want to extend the idea and create a Bot->ShadowXML  plugin that will allow me to write ShadowXML lists that I can then download to my Palm.

Would this be useful?
