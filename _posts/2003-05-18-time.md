# Time...
My brother graduates high school today. He even managed to pass enough classes to get a Distinction of Honor diploma from his "School of Choice" highschool. 

In a week and a half he'll be comming to visit. It really cannot be fast enough for Katie. She's been asking at least weekly for the last month "Is uncle Mark here het?" "No sweetie at the end of the month." "Oh. He's going to sleep in my bed?" (Cause that's where we put Rhonda as we've only got a 2 bedroom flat) "No sweetie, we'll figure out where we'll put him" "Oh. Is he here yet?"

Patience is not a trait found in my 3 year old. But she does dance to the theme music from Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True.
