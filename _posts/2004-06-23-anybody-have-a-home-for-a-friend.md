# Anybody have a home for a friend?
I have a friend CT ( <a href="http://cthompson.com/">resume</a> )  who needs work. He's willing to bend over backwards to ensure steady stable work. He's even offered several times to sleep on my couch up here for a trial contract when we were hiring.  Unfortunately we're no longer hiring.

So if anybody can find a home for him, I'd be very appreciateive.
