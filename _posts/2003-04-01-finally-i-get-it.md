# Finally I get it...
One of the small problems with the Perl6 project is that they're taking alot of ideas from Computer Science that I never got to learn. Continuations are something that's come up alot with Perl 6 (Perl 6 has them, Perl 5 does not) and I had no clue what they were. Finally someone decided to explain what the hell they are ... 
<a title="Squawks of the Parrot: Continuations and VMs" href="http://www.sidhe.org/~dan/blog/archives/000156.html">Continuations and VMs</a> (Except for the bits about VMs) next he'll explain why .NET doesn't have them. (Though I think I can understand why because .NET doesn't have <a title="Squaks of the Parrot: The Reason For Parrot, part 2" href="http://www.sidhe.org/~dan/blog/archives/000152.html">closures </a> (yet) either)
