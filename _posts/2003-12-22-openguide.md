# OpenGuide
I'm pleased to annouce the beginning of <a title="Home - OpenGuides Orlando" href="http://openguide-orlando.prather.org/">OpenGuides Orlando</a> which is my attempt at keeping track of things in the Orlando area. But if others chip in and start helping add to the website and find it useful it would become a good overall resource. For an example of a good OpenGuides website see the  original <a href="http://www.openguides.org/london">OpenGuides London</a>
