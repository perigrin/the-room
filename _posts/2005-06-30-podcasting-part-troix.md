# Podcasting part Troix
Mark was looking for a way to podcast NPR shows, I knew about PublicRadioFan.com (http://www.publicradiofan.com/podcasts.html) but found this today: <a title="43 Folders: Podcasts of non-commercial and public radio shows" href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/04/podcasts_of_non.html">43 Folders: Podcasts of non-commercial and public radio shows</a>

I decided it was better to blog it rather than simply let del.icio.us do it for me.
