# The Great Beyond
I have endevored into the great re-install and I'm
now running Windows XP Pro. We'll have to see how
well this lasts, but so far I really really like
Cleartype. So much so in fact that I've gone back
to exclusively using the Laptop's monitor despite
the 800x600 resolution it constrains me too. I'll
see if I can keep you posted

There was a short discussion with Fotios tonight
about blogging and why it facinates me. I
discovered that it's the idea that you have a
genera that is influenced heavily by the genera of
Journal writing, but is at the same time so
different because of the change of media.

Journal writing is traditionally a personal thing.
You are writing for an audiance of one, your
(future) self, and you are constrained by the
traditional limitations of print. References you
make to another work will take a noticeable ammount
of time/distance to look up unless they are either
highly personal, or very obvious.

Blogging however has neither of these traditions.
Blogging is done with the idea that others are
gonna read your work, and that you can make a
reference and it will nearly instantaneously
assocated.

An example: Have you noticed how wonderful child
hasn't been updated in a while? I can reference her
site, and presto the link is instantly available.

Idle thoughts. I try to provide content. Even if
occasionally Soq tries to eat it.
