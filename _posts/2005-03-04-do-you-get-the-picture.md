# Do you get the Picture?
So here's why I love Perl. The pictures on your right are brought to you by a 29 line Perl script (see below) which rummages through all <a href="http://chris.prather.org/photos/">my photographs</a> and presents the N most recent ones (N here obviously being 4).  It then formats everything and presents it as HTML.
