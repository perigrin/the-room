# 3 strange years...
According to the <a title="Internet Archive Wayback Machine" href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.prather.org">Internet Archive Wayback Machine</a>, this May will mark the 3 year anniversary of our possession of this domain name. It doesn't really seem like that long, but then I suppose it really is.

I've lived over seas for two years, spoken at a major industry conference, and seen many of the classics of art (David daddy David!). I've written a programming language, a half dozen websites, an IRC robot that shouts DAHUT! at people. 

I haven't written a comment script, but I plan on it.

And aparently I've redesigned the site 14 times according to the same Wayback Machine.

I realize I'm rambling here, and it's gotten a bit embarassing. Let's just finish by saying I hope I can say I've traveled as far in the next 3 years as I have in the last. 

And as I said 3 years ago, Merry Christmas Dad.
