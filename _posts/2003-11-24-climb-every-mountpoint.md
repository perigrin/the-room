# Climb Every Mountpoint
So I got my Secure Digital Card reader working on the Linux box (yes, I got the linux box working again too). This is nice because I can now move files on and off the SD card as if it were just another file system on the laptop. 

An example of how this worked well for me, a friend sent me a file in OpenOffice format, I converted it to Word97, moved the file to the SD Card, and then opened it in DocsToGo on the Palm. It "just worked".

Now because I cannot be satisfied with something so simple and elegant ... I want to add to the mix:

Let's see if we can make it work >better< than Windows.
