# Perl 6 seems to be comming along nicely.
Perl 6 seems to be comming along nicely. The Parrot
group has realeased a new version with a Perl 6
compiler that works with the code from Apocalypses
1 - 4. It also handles Ruby, Python, Scheme and
Forth (they think).

How is this cool? Well it's supposed to mean that
with Perl 6 you can link/embed to subroutines
written in each of those other languages. Which is
really very cool actually.

On the other note, I've been testing to see if I
can start blogging on my palm, but I dont' seem to
be able to get my self in gear enough to blogg
straight to the web, let alone into a memo on my
palm then cut-n-paste to the web. We'll have to see
how things move foward.

More idle prather later (happy Rhonda?)
