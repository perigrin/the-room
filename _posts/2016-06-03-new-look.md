# New Look, new digs

One of the biggest problems with dogfooding is that you're eating dogfood. I've not had the time to work on `blawd` in several years at this point.
That means that all the nits I have with it still have cumulatively stopped me from blogging.

Rather than pretend like I'll be able to fix those nits anytime soon, I've given up the ghost for now and moved to Github's Jekyll deployment.

This along with `Working Copy` and `Buffer` (a vim-based editor for iOS) mean that I should be able to edit on the fly, and as soon as my posts are pushed they'll get posted.

We'll have to see if that means I'll blog any more than I have in the last four years.
