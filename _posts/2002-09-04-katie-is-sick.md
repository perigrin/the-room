# Katie is sick...
Katie is sick, we're looking at flats, and Jamie
has an interview tomorrow to see about getting a NI
number so she can start working. Life is a bit busy
at the moment. And to top it all off Amazon hasn't
sent my copy of Object Oriented Perl yet, despite
saying it should ship in 24hrs.

Anybody have a good link to a detailed discussion
of Flyweight Object, OO Persistence, and
Class/Object Factories? I find myself lost in the
details here.
