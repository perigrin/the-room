# Look at them Changes...
Right, so I figured out how to get Moveable Type installed. Now we have some serious blogging power backing the site. You can now comment, you can now create linkbacks, you can now read the rss feed, you can now do all kinds of stuff I have no clue about because I'm still reading the manual I found in the glovebox.

Beyond that, yes it's a new look and style. It's currently still mostly the default look for MT (that's moveable type for you uninitated) and I'll probably be toying with it some in the future. Let's see where we can go from here shall we folks?
