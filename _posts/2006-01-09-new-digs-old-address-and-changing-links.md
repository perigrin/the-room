# New Digs, Old Address, and Changing Links
So I upgraded Moveable Type, I think this will work better for us now. We're now running MT 3.2 around here now. Let's see what else we can get out of this.

EDIT: And everything seems to works exactly the way it used to.

EDIT Part Deux: I've also changed the layout of the internal URLs of this site. If this breaks your links, well OMG I can't believe anybody linked to my site! (oh and my apologies) ... things are now better layed out for longevity.

Ack! My templates have changed. This will need to be sorted.
