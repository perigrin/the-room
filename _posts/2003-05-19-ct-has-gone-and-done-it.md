# CT has gone and done it...
In theory he's <a href="http://cthompson.com/entries/2003/05/41/"> enabled trackback's and comments</a> but they don't apper to be working brilliantly (or actually at all just now). But that's okay, it's the thought that counts right?

However I do have to take issue with the fact that he posts <a href="http://cthompson.com/entries/2003/05/42/">blatant and unflagged spoilers</a> on his frontpage with no warning (well there was warning he posted the same spoiler in #axkit-dahut the other day but that's beside the point). Some of us live in countries that don't get (Hollywood) movies quite as quickly, some of us live in the backwater third world that is known as simply as "everyplace else". 

On the other hand the muppet comment was funny.
