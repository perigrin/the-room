# Perl Oasis 2010 on IRC

Today it was asked if Perl Oasis had an "official" IRC channel. Since
the `#orlando` channel on irc.perl.org has been dead for *years*, I
suggested people could just use it. So if you're looking for more
information or just wanna hang out with other people going to Perl
Oasis, or are Perl people in/near/or coming to Orlando come on by!

If you are new to IRC you can use mibbit, a web based IRC client. You
can join [`#orlando`][1] directly.
