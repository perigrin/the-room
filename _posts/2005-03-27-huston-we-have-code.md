# Huston We Have Code
So I know I mentioned <a title="The Room: Organization" href="http://chris.prather.org/archives/000489.html">an Organizer</a> that I'd like to write. Well I have the <a href="http://chris.prather.org/projects/LifeHack-ToDo.tar.gz">first hack</a> of it done.

It's all very alpha, but it does everything I wanted in the previous post (when you include the unwritten web interface, and the CGI::Wiki serialization that isn't in that tarball).

Hopefully it's not just *my* itch that's scratched but several people get itches scratched as well. I've told the people in #bots about it (specifically dngnand and zool (Jo)).

If you find this, enjoy it and want to comment on it, drop me a line.
