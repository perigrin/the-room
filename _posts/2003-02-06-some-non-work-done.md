# Some Non-Work Done
I got some more work on Bender finished tonight, I extracted out his Summon code and made it its <a href="/projects/Bender/Summon.pm">own package</a> and I decided to see if I could write a simple Dahut package in the time it took dinner to cook. 

I did, it worked ...  and dinner was only >slightly< singed because I was updating the <a href="/projects">projects</a> page to reflect the changes.

Still more work to be done, but it's progress.
