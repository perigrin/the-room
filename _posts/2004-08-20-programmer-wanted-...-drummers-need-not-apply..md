# Programmer wanted ... Drummer's need not Apply.

Now, tell me how *musicians* can make a living in an environment where oligopoly distributors steal their creative work as a "work for hire", pay them by the hour for creating it, regardless of how well it sells, lock them in by contract for their next six works, and even then cheat them on the accounting.

Then tell me how *programmers* can make a living under the same conditions (minus the cheating and the oligopoly). If we eliminated the cheating and the oligopoly, would musicians have about the same deal as programmers? I suspect that it's roughly so.
