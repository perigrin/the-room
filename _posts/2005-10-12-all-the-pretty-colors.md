# All the Pretty Colors
So we have started painting the house this weekend. (hence the coming slew of del.icio.us bookmarks with 'house blog' tags)

We went with "Ruskin Green" and "Rembrandt Ruby" from the Sherman Williams Arts and Crafts style <a href=" http://www.sherwin-williams.com/do_it_yourself/paint_colors/paint_color_palette/color_themes/arts/images/imgIntArtsPalette7.jpg">colors</a>.

Next will be the hallway where we will be replacing lighting sconces too. I feel so suburbanite.
