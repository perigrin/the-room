# Tired...
I'm just  to burned out to cope much. Maybe i'll get up some energy later and finish some of the non-work things I've promised ... maybe I won't ... it's that kind of mood y'know?

By the way <a href="http://www.prather.org/~rowland/">Rhonda</a> suspects that think you don't exist. Now isn't that rude of her.

More when I become sociable I suppose. (Isn't it sad when you're too tired, and too introverted to blog.)
