So in the [last post](/new-look.html) I hoped that by moving to a github-page +
jekyll setup I would blog more. Apparently I was mistaken.

I'd started a blog post or three in the interim. My draft's folder has one from
December 2016 infact, about the way the various Perl communities are
inter-related. I have at least one ticket open for a blog post idea about
testing. But none of those promis'd joys became aught but grief an' pain.

Grief an' pain kinda sums up the last two years if I give a moment to
melancholy. I've lost people close to me, I've set aside my own businesses,
I've held my wife's hand in some of the most difficult moments of both our
lives. And that's all without turning on CNN, and listening to the current
Zeitgeist of the western world.

But that doesn't really sum up the last two eiter. I've also had the pleasure
to watch my son crossover from cubscouts to boyscouts and thrive there. He is
infact the reason that I've managed to attend a full week at scout camp for the
first time in my life. I've helped start one of the first [Troops for
Girls](https://troop42orlando.com), I've joined a great team to specifically
work with two amazing developers and friends. I've also given a couple of talks
at YAPC. The recording of the second one didn't make it out of the conference
this year, so I picked an earlier one that did.

I expect I need to settle things down and focus on the plans that have been
laid to keep them focused.
