# Depressing?
So I've already had one comment that the new look is depressing. I finally got off my ass and changed the look and feel of the website so it didn't look so much like the default website that ships with Moveable type.

Obviously things are still being worked on. I will update them as I get to them. I'm slowly building the rest of the site into the whole MT concept so that it's a bit more seemless and the navigation is a bit more standardized.

We'll see how it goes from there.
