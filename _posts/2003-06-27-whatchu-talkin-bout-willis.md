# Whatchu' Talkin 'Bout Willis?
The Bands at this year's <a title=": Dates : Warped Tour 2002- For all your information on Warped Tour and punk music" href="http://www.warped2003.com/datedetails.asp?dateid=82">Warped Tour</a> don't look all that bad. I mean yeah there's Dropkick which I would love to see live ... but there's also AFI, The Ataris, Face to Face, LTJ, Mad Caddies, Rancid, Tsunami Bomb, and Yellow card ... all of which I've decided I like (after spending several days of listening to <a href="http://www.prather.org/archives/000242.html">punk radio</a>)

So I don't know what <a href="http://mark.prather.org">Mark</a> was complaining about ... warped looks pretty damned good from here.
