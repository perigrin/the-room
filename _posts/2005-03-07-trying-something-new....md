# Trying Something New......
Trying Something New...

So there are a few dead posts that you may have seen before I deleted them.
I'm trying a new Auto Blogging script I wrote to allow me to automatically
blog files posted to a directory. This should make things much easier for me,
I can write simple text files on my palm pilot, rsync them into the proper
directory and then things will automatically sync them up to the server.

Hopefully this all works. We shall see.
