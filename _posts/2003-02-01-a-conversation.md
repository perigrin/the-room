[22:22:40] rto3rd: wow...I just disconnected by ethernet cable instead of the power cable...I was surprised it worked
[22:23:07] MarceusX: You've got a few seconds of delay where you just drop packets.
[22:23:26] rto3rd: I know, I just didn't think I was fast enough.   AIM ususally just dies anyway.
[22:23:32] MarceusX: Check the floor you might find them lying there.
[22:24:16] rto3rd: ::sweep, sweep::
[22:24:33] rto3rd: Of course then the question becomes, "Now what do I do with the darn things?"
[22:25:19] MarceusX: Well if there are enough of them you can eat them.
[22:25:30] MarceusX: You have of course heard the prase "A Byte to Eat"
[22:25:31] rto3rd: But they were on the floor.
[22:25:49] rto3rd: I'm not even going to comment on that one Mr. Prather.
[22:25:55] MarceusX: Hehe...
[22:26:03] MarceusX: i know but it would torture Christy now wouldn't it?
[22:26:08] rto3rd: Blog it.
