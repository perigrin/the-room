# Tim Says Give Yourself a URL
<a title="Give yourself a URI | Decentralized Information Group (DIG) Breadcrumbs" href="http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/71">Give yourself a URI | Decentralized Information Group (DIG) Breadcrumbs</a>

Do you have a URI for yourself? If you are reading this blog and you have the ability to publish stuff on the web, then you can make a FOAF page, and you can give yourself a URI.
