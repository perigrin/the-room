# Sharing Time
So I've been trying to find a calendaring solution for Jamie and I. Here's the break down of the problem. We both have palm pilots (meaning both running Palm OS), but we each sync with our own computers. She uses Windows, I use Mac. Now the Mac has no issue, iSync syncs with iCal which can publish my calendar to a DAV server. Windows, no such luck. The options are PalmDesktop or Outlook. PalmDesktop supports manually "exporting" to VCard format, and Outlook sucks ass (I use it at work) and is expensive (work pays me good money to use it at work).

I've tried setting up Jamie's computer to sync with [Google Calendar][gcal] but the sync conduit blew up every time I tried using it. I've looked at OpenGroupware.org, but installation isn't trivial under [Gentoo][gentoo] (the OS running behind [home.prather.org][home] ). 

So far the only solution I've found is half hearted. Palm has a [DualDate][dual] application that let's you look at your own calendar, and *one* other shared calendar. It's not a perfect solution, but it works for now I hope.
