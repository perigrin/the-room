# Sunday Morning Coming Down
So just as I had given Orlando radio up for totally lost and a desolate wasteland that only had the (aging) [Sunday Night Vinyl](http://www.wtks.com/pages/sundaynightvinyl.html), I sat down this morning and discovered ][this](http://www.wtks.com/pages/smcd.html). A full 2 hour alt-country show on the radio, this cements my love of WTKS on the weekends (now if only it were a [commercial free](http://minnesota.publicradio.org/radio/services/the_current/)). I'm only sad that the Saturday Night show put on by Dan Stone is no longer with us.
