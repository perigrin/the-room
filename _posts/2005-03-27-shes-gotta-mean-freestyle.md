# "She's Gotta Mean Freestyle"
<blockquote>Nancy is the backbone of the outreach. She does the bulk of the behind the scenes work. She knows all and she is the master coordinator. She's the catylist that makes the vision turn into the practical. You find her during the outreach with the single file line of outreachers and leaders with questions. She has a mean freestyle.</blockquote> -- <a title="gainesville outreach" href="http://www.gainesvilleoutreach.com/">gainesville outreach</a>

Go Nancy, Go Nancy, Go Nancy
