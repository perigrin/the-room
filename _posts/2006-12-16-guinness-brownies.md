# Guinness Brownies

    Servings: 8 to 10 servings
    Prep. Time: 0:25
    Total Time: 1:00

    Ingredients:	
        4 eggs
        3/4 cup superfine sugar
        8 oz. bittersweet chocolate, chopped
        4 oz. white chocolate, chopped
        6 tbsp. unsalted butter
        3/4 cup all-purpose flour
        3/4 cup cocoa
        1-1/4 cups Guinness stout
        Confectioners' sugar, for dusting

    Directions:
<code>Preheat the oven to 375&deg;F and grease an 8-inch-square pan. Beat together the eggs and sugar until 
light and fluffy. In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt the bittersweet chocolate, white 
chocolate and butter, stirring until smooth. Remove from heat and beat into the egg mixture. Sift 
the flour and cocoa together and beat into the chocolate mixture. Whisk in the Guinness. Pour into 
the pan and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a skewer inserted in the center comes out almost 
clean. Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack. To serve, dust the cake with 
confectioners' sugar and cut into squares. </code>

So I made these tonight. They're very ... adult. If you like dark chocolate you'll love these. If you don't ... you won't. I need to try them with Hot Fudge and Vanilla Ice Cream.
