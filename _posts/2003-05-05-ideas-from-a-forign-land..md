# Ideas from a forign land.
A <a title="Windley's Enterprise Computing Weblog" href="http://www.windley.com/2003/05/01.html#a595">Municple Goverment Broadband Network</a> [via <a href="http://use.perl.org/~ziggy/journal/11985">Ziggy</a>]  does sound like a very good idea.

I wish more municiple goverments would check in and realize that setting up internet access really should be on the same level as water, gas, and electricity. Simply a municiple service that people can subscribe to. Then again I'm a radical, I believe that infrastructure technologies should probably be goverment run.

This follows along with <a href="http://www.sidhe.org/~dan/blog/archives/000180.html">Dan's commentary on tax cuts while deficit spending</a>

It's amazing the thing I can have an opinion on when I'm not even in that country.
