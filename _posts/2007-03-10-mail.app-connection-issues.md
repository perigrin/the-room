# Mail.app connection issues
After several months of trying various things, giving up, trying again ... etc. My connection issues with Mail.app and my mail server are fixed. Turns out that my mail server (exim) didn't like the IPV6 address that mail.app was for some reason feeding it. I was getting "syntactically invalid argument(s): [?\031?\033???IPv6:::1]". Commenting out the IPV6 loopback (::1) in my /etc/hosts file fixed it. Thanks to the comments at the end of http://www.oreillynet.com/sysadmin/blog/2006/03/ssh_tunnelling_apple_mail.html for the solution
