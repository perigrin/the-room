# Life is so unfair.
From <a href="http://piratemonkeysinc.com/quiz.htm">this page</a> Christy posted in her blog:

<pre>
12. You are more...
 A) decisive
 B) indecisive
</pre>

Right so if you're B like me you're obviously still trying to choose. Life is so unfair.

Christy also pointed out <a href="http://piratemonkeysinc.com/wsdm.htm">this image</a> which happily was printed, and taped to my office wall.
