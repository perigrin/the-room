# The scary scary future
A friend of mine is the Chair of a new W3C working group: <a title="XML Binary Characterization Working Group Public Page" href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Binary/">XML Binary Characterization Working Group Public Page</a>

Which is for the lay-person, a group focused on taking Web Pages and making them small enough that you can easily put them on Cell Phones.
