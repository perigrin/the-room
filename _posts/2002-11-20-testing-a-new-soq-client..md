# Testing a new Soq client.
Testing a new Soq client. I'm working to see if
everything seems okay. Seem okay to you?

::time passes::

Well it all worked appropriately it seems. I can
update prather.org again using Soq. Although I need
to spend some time working on the site to update it
to properly use the Blogging squid stuff that Luke
has built (SoqList) as well as some ideas I have
for Soq/Blogging/mod_perl integration. More later,
if I find the time.
