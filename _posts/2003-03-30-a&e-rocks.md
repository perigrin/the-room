# A&E Rocks!
<a title="Neil Gaiman" href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/journal.asp">Neil Gaiman</a>

A&E are aparently releasing Neverwhere on DVD in America. I'm so excited. Can we say want/need? 

Also Neil (as if we're on a first name basis ... me and Neil ...) mentions http://www.etymonline.com/ an online Entomology website. Which will be added to my OED bookmark at work.
