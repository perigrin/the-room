# The view from the Toilets...
<a href="http://www.prather.org/images/18_02_03_seat.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.prather.org/images/18_02_03_seat.html','popup','width=740,height=555,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">Arthur's Seat</a>

It's ever so impressive isn't it? Unfortunately I didn't take this picture (I believe Bob did ...) but it's roughly identical to that we get from the toilets in our office.
