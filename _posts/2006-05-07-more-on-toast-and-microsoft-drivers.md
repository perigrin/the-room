# More on Toast and Microsoft Drivers
Regarding Rhonda's "[Chris...a little blog housekeeping][1]"...

The Piers Anthony story is inventively titled "The Toaster" in *[Anthonology][2]*. (Yes I had to Google for it.) 

As for trusting my life to devices powered by Microsoft software. I'm pretty sure you're right I'd hate to do it. However cars are increasingly sophisticated and software driven ... and I wonder how many people have broken down up here in -40 degree weather because a device driver failed.
