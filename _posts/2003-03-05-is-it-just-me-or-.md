# Is it just me or ...
Was there alot of time travel episodes in Star Trek Voyager? 

It seems like each show had it's own theme. The original series was a western (litterally promoted to the powers that be as a Wagon Train to the stars). The Next Generation was very political (very fitting for the late 80's early 90's). DS9 had a heavy religious theme (okay so I didn't watch it alot ... but I remember there was alot of alternate realty and religious themes). And the Voyager crew just couldn't keep themselves in one timeline for more than seven episodes.

Right, it's far too late when I've read this much into things.
