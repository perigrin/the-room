# Cafe au Laptop
>Coffee shops all over the Twin Cities are morphing into literary salons, jammed with so many people banging away on computers that it's a struggle to get to the half-and-half.
<cite> [Lattes and laptops][1] </cite>

I have a friend "[Nacho][2]" who due to his status as a telecommuter can work from Cafe's a lot. Having occasionally pulled a "nacho" myself from a [local internet cafe][3] while Katie was in [art class][4] I can understand the allure. I wonder if this movement might not possibly grow into a revitalization of the [Salon's of Paris][5] during the last three centuries.
