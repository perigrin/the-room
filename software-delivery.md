# Software Delivery! 

I was just reading Matt Asay's [piece][1] about Domino's using open
source to build out their multi-million dollar order fulfillment system.
His take away quote got me thinking.

The gist of this is that these companies like Domino's will be building
up their internal IT departments to largely take on the kinds of
projects that they would previously buy enterprise grade software from Microsoft or SAP. I disagree.

I think (or perhaps hope) that this is the first step in a further
evolution. There is no long term economic reason why Domino's should be
in the the software development business. That's not their core
business. Saying that the future of open source jobs is working for the
Domino's internal software development group is like saying 20 years ago
that the future of open source is the Operating System.

I suspect in 20 years time that there will be (or recently have been) a
shift from large in-house IT teams, to outsourced teams of consulting
companies and independent contractors. Teams of people already surround
open source projects. Some of these people are in-house developers at
large corporations like Asay's article talks about (the Moose community
for example has people from Walmart, the BBC, and Omni Hotels). Some of
these developers work at smaller consultancies (again Moose has people
from [Infinity Interactive][3], [Best Practical][4], and my own
[Tamarou][5][^1]). Some of these people are even independent contractors.

It seems like a very short step for these organizations do the heavy
lifting for an enterprise level IT Project. The Corporate Sponsor could
then choose to either hire a skeleton maintenance staff, or keep one or
more of the project's organizations on retainer.

In his book _The Four Hour Work Week_, Tim Ferris coined a term
'geo-arbitrage'. Arbitrage is the practice of taking advantage of a
difference in prices between two or more markets. Geo-arbitrage is
taking advantage of physically distinct markets (say India vs Europe).
Geo and temporal arbitrage are what cause the radical lowering of cost
for open source[^2]. Developers who are emotionally committed to a project somehow find non-monetary ways to value their time.

Currently large corporations leverage geo arbitrage with a few very
large strokes. They'll off-shore their internal developments staff
(setting up a development office in Mumbai or Beijing for example), or
they'll hire an external company to perform a large project. I don't
think this will change, but I think that this will become much more
sophisticated as time goes on. Large consultancies will themselves
outsource development rather than hire more developers and maintain a
large staff, or perhaps smaller consultancies will band together to
tackle projects normally handled by the larger consultancies.

The benefits for companies like Domino's are enormous. For starters
smaller focused software shops are already experts in their specific
tool chain and domain. Teaching a programmer who has already built six
order fulfillment applications enough about the Pizza industry to drive
an application story is easier than doing the reverse with an executive
in the Pizza industry, or even a talented programmer who has no relevant
experience.

Second finding and retaining good developers is *hard*. Finding
committed developers with a passion for an Open Source stack is even
harder. Scott Adams (yes Dilbert's creator) recently 
[noticed a trend][6].

The best developers are already thinking of striking out on their own.
These are already the people who are clued in. Why not let them step out
on their own, and hire them back with a few of their talented friends in
the community as a consultant? That IT manager may have been incompetent
as an IT manager, but he or she might make an excellent liaison to the
new consultants. Sometimes it is easier to work *with* someone than
*for* someone.

Also, some corporations are limited by law or economic reasons to their
local market they are and they may have to make decisions based not on
what is **best** but rather on what is **available**. A consultancy or
contractor may have a lot more flexibility in the options they can bring
to the table. Perhaps they have experience handing telecommuter teams,
while your company doesn't. They might be able to hire a developer from
Israel, who lives part times in France, and can finish that project in a
week and a half.

I'm not trying to gloss over the downsides of out sourcing. It is by no
means always a rosy magical world of happiness. I am simply trying to
illimunate the current efforts at outsourcing as the clumsy beginnings
of what will become a much more sophisticated market.

Some may claim that this will inevitably lead to the same situation we
have today where the consultancies of tomorrow have a single product
that they schlep from project to project. They may be correct, time will
have to tell. I suspect that the truth in 20 years will be even stranger than we know.

Update: Apparently the Perl Ironman blogging contest wants me to mention CPAN as well for it to show up. 

[^2]: Temporal-arbitrage being the concept that even in the same place, all other things being equal, prices change depending on the time. 

[^1]: Actually there are far more consulting companies than these three active in teh community, and I've been told it was remiss to not point out [ShadowCat](http://shadowcat.co.uk) as well as [CloudTone](http://cloudtone.ca)
