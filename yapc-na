I'm off to [YAPC][3] tomorrow. I'm giving [two][1] [talks][2] on Tuesday and I haven't yet finished my slides (though I do think I have some clue what I'm gonna talk about). This is the first time in six years I've spoken at something as large as a YAPC and I'm starting to feel a little nervous. Unlike six years ago however this time I'm expecting to see a bunch of faces that I know. Hallway tracking OSCON last year was one of the better experiences I've had in my career and I'm hoping this is more like that. Either way I'm not expecting to get my (ir)regular posting back again until after next week ... but then again I may brain dump stuff about [XML::Toolkit][4] since it's the topic of one of the talks and has been getting a ton of work this week.
