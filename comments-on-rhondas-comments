# Comments on Rhonda's Comments
In response to Rhonda's [Comments on Chris's Post][1]

Yes comments do seem to be broken. However if you ping me sometime via IM I'll show you how you can use the OpenID system. In fact something is very wonky, because I couldn't post a comment to your comment about our comments being down.

Back to the main gist...

I agree whole heartedly with using either /mobile/ or mobile.tld.com. In fact I have setup [http://mobile.saintpaul.openguides.org][2] as my mobile version of that site precisely because mobile.foo was the most common (2 out of 5) usage in the examples from the article I linked to.

I haven't setup a mobile version of our blogs yet because ... bleh, people certainly have more time on their hands ... and more importantly our readers haven't whined in her LiveJournal account about her inability to read our sporadic posts via her cell phone.
