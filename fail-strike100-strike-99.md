# FAIL <strike>100</strike> 99
I've just released [XML::NamespaceSupport][1] 1.10, with fixes to it's build system. I've had it soaking as a dev release for the last week or two, ever since I noticed it was #6 on Adam Kennedy's [Fail 100][2]. I had to chase down Robin Berjon and get him to delegate co-maint, but it was a simple enough once that happened. One down, 99 to go.
