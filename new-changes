# New Changes
I have been re-organizing again. There will be a new look and feel when I get a chance to finish all the templates. There is a new URL structure, entries have categories and are saved into those categories. So all my endless drivel about Poker is saved into it's <a href="/poker">own special place</a>.

Also I'm trying to figure out ways to make the whole process easier for myself, and more interesting for people who wander past. I'm getting better about posting, and soon I might actually attempt to write longer posts about things that  aren't innane.
