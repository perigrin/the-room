# Perl Oasis 2010: Discount Hotel Rates End

November 25th is the last day for the Perl Oasis special Group Rate. The
rate is $75 USD / night for what according to other sources is a
$135-$150 / night hotel room.

[Perl Oasis][1] is a one day workshop in Orlando Florida focusing on
Modern Enlightened Perl. This year we have speakers from three
continents, and the entire Perl spectrum speaking. The Call for Speakers
is still open so you can [submit your talk][2] as well!
