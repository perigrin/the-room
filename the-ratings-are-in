Hmm, we (Mark, Rhonda, and I) got about 315 hits  per day last week. That's not too terrible is it?

<a href="http://www.fotios.cc/">Fotios.cc</a> however reportedly get's 622 hits/day ... but he's running a radio station on Shoutcast to generate hits.

Mark, Rhonda, if you want the breakdown check inside.
