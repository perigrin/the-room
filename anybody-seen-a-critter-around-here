Title: Anybody Seen a Critter around here?

When we move back to the states, one idea Jamie and I both have is to build a computer for Katie, she's just old enough to really start enjoying playing with them. We'd like to give her something fun, and I've been looking into Case Mods. 

I've seen a few animal case mods that but they're  not wonderful. At the worst I can probably buy a couple can's of spraypaint and an animal print stencil and just go wild. But I'd like to see if there is anything cooler than that for her.

Has anybody seen a decent case mod that is Katie oriented?
