# Every 28 Days...
Jamie suggested that every my Bus Pass' was rather like a period.  It cycles every 28 days and is a big hassle to deal with. 

I pointed out that I didn't get really moody just before getting a bus pass though, and she just glared at me.

...

In other news, I think I have gotten my <a href="http://mark.prather.org/">brother</a>'s graduation present organized. My parent's are sending him to visit me as his High School graduation present. What I'm wondering is are they simply punishing me for taking their granddaughter overseas?

Just kidding. I'm actually quite excited by this. I haven't really gotten to hang out with him for any length of time in several years and it'll be cool to take him to see stuff around town and in the highlands.
