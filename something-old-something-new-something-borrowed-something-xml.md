# Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Something XML
With the blessing of Barrie Slaymaker, I've released a new version [XML::SAX::Machines][1]. This is the first release in 5 years, and fixes a two year old RT ticket about the use of psudo-hashes (which are deprecated and removed in perl 5.10). I plan on trying to resolve the other issues in RT and working with it and my own [XML::Toolkit][2] as time goes by. If you don't know what SAX Machines are you should really check out [Kip Hampton's article][3] on XML.com.
