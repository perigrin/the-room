Title: Keeping Trac of Things

I have gotten the svk + svn + trac love working on my home systems. I should have done this weeks ago but didn't think about it until yesterday or so. Basically though I can now work on either <a href="http://trac.home.prather.org/bender">Bender</a> or my <a href="http://trac.home.prather.org/poker">Poker Server</a> anywhere and sync it via SVK, then have the changes appear nicely in the Trac so I can keep track of what I'm doing. In theory this also would allow collaboration with others but I doubt that I'll find anyone to collaborate with.
