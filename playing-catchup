Let's see. 

Paris was wonderful. Long stories that need to be thought about and posted later.

I've been horribly busy with work because we released our project about two days before I returned from Paris ... and then comes the bugfixing. 

Elsewhere I got a sourceforge account for SoqL (http://www.sf.net/projects/soql/) which means there's public code and people can share freely. Feel free.

Let's see Dahut.pm finally got moving ... I subbed everybody to the mailing list and boom 30 messages in 20 minutes. DAHUUT. I've got all sorts of ideas now for Bender. He's the president of Dahut.pm ... which is fitting ... a non-geographical group with a non-corporeal president.

More later I supppose.
