# Captain Carrot Returns!
<blockquote>
It's as if Captain Carrot was never cancelled, and we're catching up the ongoing series. What's different now is that-- like nearly every other superhero title currently published-- CCAHAZC! has gone 'grim 'n' gritty,' with all that entailsâ€¦except we're doing more of a parody of 'Watchmen' and 'Dark Knight' and their fallout which has led, over the last few decades, to modern-day stuff like 'Infinite Crisis.' Lost faith and innocence, heroes-in-hiding, a teammate's betrayal, murder; it's all there, only funny animal-style.</blockquote>
