# Conflict
Well two (possibly) conflicting things happened today.

First, I sent out the annoucements that the Orlando PerlMongers would be holding their first ever meeting next Tuesday (March 23) at 7:00pm at Kate O'Brien's downtown.

Which is something I've been trying to help get off the ground since well since before I left the UK actually. But I've been seriously working at since January.

Then later in my e-mail I get a letter from Reuters saying that they'd like me to fill out some forms so they could offer me a job. So I may be moving to St. Paul in the not so distant future.
