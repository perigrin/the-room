# Squidoo and Godin's MBA
So I'm enchanted by <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a> right now. I've read a few of his books, and listened to his latest audiobook (<a href="http://www.squidoo.com/tribesbook">Tribes</a>). A couple weeks ago he came out with an [Alternative MBA Proposal](http://www.squidoo.com/Alternative-MBA), and I sent the link to my brother. Reading [his responses](http://www.squidoo.com/Godin-application) drove me to make my [own responses](http://www.squidoo.com/Response-to-Alternative-MBA).

Which turned out to be a bit of a cathartic moment in which I dumped a bunch of stuff that I had pent up, and really something that should be included here where I nominally store such stuff. So for now I'm capturing the link to that and spreading some of the discussion of that around to this blog.
