>Netcraft said it identified a total of 80,655,992 websites, which represents an increase of 3.1 million since the end of February. In March of 2003, Netcraft reported the existence of about 40 million web sites.

This is great, it means I will probably have a job for the rest of my life. Woohoo. However the rest of the article is terrifying:

>Compared to the previous month, Apache lost six percentage points from 68.7% to 62.7% due to a large-scale migration from Apache to Microsoft software at domain registrar GoDaddy.

This means that because a *single registrar* decided to shift server platforms ... the server market sees a 5 point shift in demographics? It terrifies me how concentrated hosting is, especially with GoDaddy.
