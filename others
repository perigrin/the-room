So others have chosen. Rhonda has setup <a href="http://www.prather.org/~rowland/">Crazy Goes This World</a> on a most excellent hosting provider I must say.

Beyond that I've managed to figure out that I need to set the width attribute in the CSS files to keep my posts from screaming off the side in IE 6. If things look horrible please tell me.

Time shall see what happens next.
