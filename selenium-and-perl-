This came across the [Perl Signals][signals] recently:

Because this is something we've talked about at work and I have a friend [Mike
Nachbaur][nacho] who has done extensive work with Perl and Selenium for automated
testing, I asked him about it.

He also should have mentioned his own [Test::A8N][a8n] which does "Storytest
Automation", which is a fancy way of saying automated acceptance tests.
