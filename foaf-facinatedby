# foaf:FacinatedBy

>I have this idea of using FOAF predicates as tags in Del.icio.us. For example, if I want to express “harrychen foaf:knows timfinin”, I would bookmark Tim Finin’s homepage on Del.icio.us, and tag it with “foaf:knows”. If want to express “harrychen foaf:workplaceHomepage http://www.imagem.cc”, I would bookmark Image Matters LLC’s homepage, and tag it with “foaf:workplaceHomepage”.

This idea is so sick it might just work. Though I'm not sure I want to explore the idea of distributed resource persistence via Delicious. 

Also I just had a though, I wonder if I could scrape my tags and convert them into a foaf:interests lists ...
