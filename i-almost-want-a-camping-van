# I almost want a camping van
<a href="http://www.northwales.org.uk/bio-power/index.htm">Bio-Diesel </a> makes me want a Diesel car, which will only encourage Jamie's desire for a VW Camping Van.

I'm just nervous because neither of us is "car" people and outside of driving them I don't know the first thing about them. Computer's I'm fine with ... ripping apart a car gives me the willies. It's just a matter of never having learned anything about automotive mechanics (beyond the basic physics of it). Anybody know a simple way to learn diesel motor mechanics in your spare time?
