# "Patches Welcome" or Volunteers vs Hobbyists #

There has been a strong meme going around that I've not been paying
attention to until today. I'm not sure my opinion really matters here
but I thought I'd add my perspective which doesn't seem to be
represented well in the discussion.

I've been paid as a Perl developer for a little over a decade now. I've
been involved in various degrees in the Perl Community for a little less
than a decade. I have been what I consider actively involved in the Perl
community for only about 3-4 years. In that time I've watched [some
projects][axkit] I've been involved with flounder and effectively die,
and [other projects][moose] not. I've worked for 
[very large companies][reuters] with a DarkPAN problem, and for 
[very small companies][ii] that contribute heavily to CPAN. I am currently 
running [another][tamarou].

All of this is background to say "I've been around the block a few times".

So the current "Patches Welcome" … discussion … seems to be based around
the idea that CPAN contributors should treat their volunteer work as if
it were equal to their day jobs. The analogy made is that of a volunteer
Firefighter, or Nurse, or the extreme example the Peace Corps[^1].

I think the analogy to Volunteers like this breaks down. Those jobs are
never treated as hobbies. A CTO I used to work for is a volunteer
firefighter. He will never get a call and say "you know, I just ate a
big plate of ribs, I'm gonna sit this one out". I'm sure if he did, the
rest of the squad would say "Dude, don't come back." (If they didn't, I
would have serious qualms about moving into that community).

Anything I've uploaded to CPAN that I wasn't directly paid to do was
done because I love doing it, recreationally. It's a hobby. RelaxNG
support for XML::Toolkit won't happen until I am in the mood. If have a
problem with that, and would like it to not be a hobby for me, I have an
hourly rate that is I'm told very reasonable[^2]. I hate saying that,
but it's true[^3].

As a hobby FOSS programming is a team sport. "Patches Welcome" is an
invitation to play.

If you ran into Tony Hawk skating at the Brooklyn Banks, would you tell
him his flip kick was a little off or ask him to help you with your pop
shove-it? Yeah, me neither. But if we were to do so, and he replied "hey
I'm busy right now, why don't you show me what you mean"? What if he
phrased it like "show it, hot shot"? That shouldn't automatically translate
to "screw you, I'm TONY HAWK!", it's challenge to participate.

I've never skated in my life, but if a professional skate
boarder[^4][^5] offered to work with me if I were to show up and try. I
would[^6]. If I can't or don't try to participate, does that reflect on
them?

"Patches Welcome" is an invitation to play. It may be said during a
period of frustration or exhaustion. It may be said to people who don't
know the first thing about the game. It may even be said by people who
mean to say "screw you, I'm STEVAN LITTLE!". That doesn't
make it any less of an invitation.

I have already [started discussing][help] what we as a community can do
about increasing the number of Professional opportunities available[^7].
If you want to discuss how people should be more Professional about
their recreation, you really need to look at the definitions of
[those][professional] [terms][recreation].

[^1]: At least nobody is asking CPAN contributors to move to Mongolia
for two years. Though it is wonderful if you want to
[volunteer](http://www.peacecorps.gov) to do so. They have more
requirements than CPAN for contribution though.

[^2]: I estimate the cost of RNG support in XML::Toolkit to be about a
minimum of $6000 USD at Tamarou's current rates. If you would like to
Volunteer as a FOSS programmer, please contact me I can definitely use
unpaid professional labour right now.

[^3]: Think of it like a dual-license.

[^4]: Doesn't have to be Tony Hawk. Elissa Steamer, Bucky Lasek, Jason
Lee if you're reading this I'll happily bust my ass on a board at your
direction as well. I would love to learn to kick-flip before I die, but
I suspect being able to ollie is a required skill I lack.

[^5]: You can replace skateboarding with any profession here too, I'm
pretty sure if Christian Jacobs were to ask me to sit in with the
Aquabats because I said that he'd gotten sloppy on _Charge!_ with his
horn section, even though I'm not a professional musician, you'd bet
your ass I'd be sitting in with the band. Same thing for Mr. Gaiman and
his loose plotting (although I adore his prose style).

[^6]I'm not expecting to even be contacted by a professional
skateboarder. I'm pretty sure ours is the only industry where not
responding to complaints in a blog some where somehow makes us less
professional too.

[^7]: One of Tamarou's explicit goals is to grow the number of Perl
related business opportunities in the world.
