The athens 2004 olympics have a rather hideous <a title="Hyperlink Policy" href="http://www.athens2004.com/athens2004/page/legacy?lang=en&cid=dd7e01e3ac979f00VgnVCMServer28130b0aRCRD">Hyperlink Policy</a> (which I just violated). 

It requires you to present a request *in writing* before hyperlinking. You can go ahead and link after mailing the request, because they will only contact you if they feel it's not appropriate.

Talk about draconic, and well technologically backwards.
