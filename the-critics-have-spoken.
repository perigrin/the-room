Title: The Critics have spoken.

Well the critics ... um well critic ... has spoken.
Marsae at WonderfulChild,
who pestered me endlessly about what a Blog was and
what she should have for a blog and what it should
be called, then complained about the old look of
the site as being rather "plain."

Well there is a reason, I'm not using Blogger or
Movable Type, or any other blogging software but
something a bit more home grown. And while I have
full faith in the future of my little programming
efforts, work keeps me
from concetrating on more important things ... like
blogging. So I can't devote the proper ammount of
time to desiging this site.

Speaking of blogging and Marsae ... I was wondering
if she'd be interested in a challenege with the
blog-a-thon. I don't think she could come up with
24-hours worth of posts.
