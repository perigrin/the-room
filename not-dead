# Not dead...
Well I'm not dead. Despite any rumors to the contrary. At this very moment I'm sitting in a friends living room in northern Germany (hour or two drive from the north sea) and we're looking at what we'll be doing for the next two weeks in England before we travel Home (via Iceland).

So that should answer the questions as to where I am. 

I plan on doing something with the notes and information we've gathered from our vacation. We're quite exhausted but are planning on building Katie some way to remember her trip. I expect that going through that process I will end up with some blog matieral that should have really been posted while in transit but well... obviously wasn't.

Two weeks till we return home and I can't think of anything to say.
More later I suppose.
