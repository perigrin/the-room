This streamed across <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> (which I've just started <a href="http://del.icio.us/perigrin">using</a>) <a title="SIGNAL ORANGE" href="http://www.signalorange.net/home.html">SIGNAL ORANGE</a> which interests me but I'm not sure why. Possibly because I'm listening to alot of Anti-Flag and Chomsky at the moment.

I'm wondering if the corporate media will pick up on this, or even if the non-corporate media (read blogosphere) will really start pushing it. It depends I suppose on how big a splash they make at the RNC convention.
