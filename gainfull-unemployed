# Gainfull Unemployed
So I should have mentioned this before but I'm amongst the gainfull unemployed now. Yes it is a bit early but not much considering I was planning on leaving in two weeks anyway.

If you're desperate to hire me please by all means check out my <a title="Prather.org" href="http://www.prather.org/cv.html">CV</a> (also called a resume in the States).

And if you want someone of a slightly finer vintage ... I found out that my Mom is now gainfully unemployed as well. She know's Cobol and CICS if you're into masochistic things. Unfortunately I don't have her CV available.
