# Lists
I love lists for some reason, the Top 50 Books You Must Read stuff, the 1000 Places to See Before You Die ... all of it. I have a Todo List at [HiveMinder](http://hiveminder.com), I have my recently played list at [Last.fm](http://last.fm/user/marceus), I have a list of recent messages at [Identi.ca](http://identi.ca/perigrin) ... just now I stumbled across a blog post that was talking about top 5 commands ...
