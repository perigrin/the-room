# It's not really suprising...
That <a title="William Gibson" href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/blog.asp">William Gibson</a> has a stylistically more avant guard blog than <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/journal.asp">Neil Gaimen</a>.

Luckily Neil isn't ending his weblog like Gibson is. Yeah Neil!
