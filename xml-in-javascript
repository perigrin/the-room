The beginning of <a title="XML.com: XML and JavaScript in the Browser [Mar. 26, 2003]" href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/03/26/qa.html">this</a> article. talks about some XML processors for JavaScript which look pretty neat.

JavaScript has gained alot of respect from me in recent months because I'm finding it has most of the high level constructs I like in Perl ...
