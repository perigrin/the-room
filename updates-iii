# Updates III
So I didn't intend for it to be two weeks. I got my super secret project done. [The SaintPaul Guide][1] and [The Victoria Guide][2] both have JSON output working now. Hopefully Nacho's day job will give him a chance to play with it soon. 

I have also in the last two weeks, done quite a bit of cleaning house, tested the [mobile version][3] (with Jamie's new [LifeDrive][4] which uses the same browser as the Treo) and added an Image metadata field (the biggest reaction to which has been "Yay! What's it for?"). All in all things are coming along, but slowly.
