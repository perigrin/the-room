There is alot of yelling, door slamming, ignoring
and crying going on. Kaite is either acting out all
of her 2 tendancies, or has suddenly turned 16. I
hate it when my Mom was right.
Jamie has an interview/party/something on Sunday to
work for "The Pottery Experience" which I think
would be wonderful for her. I'm totally hoping she
gets some kind of a job there. They offer ceramics
courses and Jamie has some experience teaching
them, and has this dream of teaching a Mom &amp;
Tots art class.
