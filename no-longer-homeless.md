# No Longer Homeless
After 3 months of searching, 6 offers, and countless hours of pain and agony we shall soon be home owners (I think).

Tomorrow we do the final paperwork to have an accepted offer on a new house (well new to us) in Como Park.

Hopefully I won't be too horribly distracted by it all to not post pictures and more information.
