<blockquote>After all, one of the stated design goals of XML was that any semi-competent computer science graduate student with a bathtub full of crystal meth and a burning desire to reinvent the wheel could write an XML parser over spring break and still have time to lather up with body paints and make obscene gestures at the MTV cameraman by the pool of the El Palacio hotel. Writing an HTML parser that can handle the crud your average website throws at it is more likely to require a PhD in Kantian Philosophy, a mild case of Aspergerâ€™s Syndrome and a sperm sample from Johnny Mnemonic. </blockquote>
