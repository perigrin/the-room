# Sorry about the delay...
Sorry about the delay, went to 
Orchardton this weekend (it's the house in the
background). We ended up helping herd the sheep in
to the house, it's sad when seven very intelligent
people are out witted by a group of six sheep. But
eventually we won, and they were shorn.

We also got new pictures of Kaitlynn online. There
is a page here of
older pictures and a page here with
a very nice Black &amp; White from Laura (kirsty's
mom). And another picture of Kirsty which
Jamie want's to duplicate with Katie.

Hopefully Jamie will get the pictures from this
weekend developed while I have enough time to scan
them (she's only works with film ... digital just
is not good enough when you blow it up aparently
... she's a bit of a camera snob). But if they are
scanned before Jamie and Katie leave the country
I'll try to get them up as well.
