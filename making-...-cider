# Making ... Cider
So a friend (dngor) brews his own beer. And I'm realizing that I'll be moving back to the US and will be lacking regular cider on tap. Which got me to wondering about brewing my own Cider.

Dngor found me this <a title="ASHLYNN'S GROVE ~ Craft Brewing - Cider Recipes" href="http://www.paganism.com/ag/brew/craftcdr.html">ASHLYNN'S recipe</a> and will probably prove to be a good resource to setting up my own moonshine...er still... er brewhause.
