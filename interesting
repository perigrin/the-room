Right so I did drop off the face of the earth a bit. I'm sorry. I've been traveling (gone to seen the Highlands, damn they're high).

I found this: 

<a title="janusnode.com" href="http://janusnode.com/">janusnode.com</a>

Which is interesting in that it combines a computer generated narritive application with a nice name.  It makes me wish I had a mac so I could try it out.
