Last night our local PBS station showed <a title="Ramones: End of the Century" href="http://www.endofthecentury.com/">Ramones: End of the Century</a> which is simply amazing. 

I loved the Ramones before but didn't really know much about them beyond they were one of the US punk bands that mirrored the scene in Camden. This documentary however shows how they played for 20 years, and never managed to get a traditional record deal. How depressing. Beyond that though this documentary is one that I would own simply to show people how a documentary should be made. I highly reccomend taking Kurt Loder's suggestion and hunting it down wherever possible.
