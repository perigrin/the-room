# Upgrades
So, I've added a few plugins to the Moveable Type install that powers this blog (as well as [Crazy Goes This World][1])

### Text Formatting 
* [Markdown][2]                                     
* [SmartyPants][3]

### Blog Templating
* [CatEntries][4]

### Security
* [OpenID Comments][5]
* [OpenID Server for Moveable Type][6]

Generally my hope is to improve the quality of blogging on this server by making it a nicer place to blog from.
