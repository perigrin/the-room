# Scholarships and Loans
In case someone were interested, I've found a list of   Scolarships, Grants, Awards and Loans 
... in case someone were interested.

Actually I'm pretty sure that if he's already have seen (and possibly rejected) most of these. But he can contact me for the details to <a href="http://www.scolarships.com">the site I pulled them from</a>. They have details on all of them, as well as submission forms for student loans and goverment grants.

* Note ... I really intended to link to <a href="http://www.scholarships.com">here</a> the other was totally un-intentional.
