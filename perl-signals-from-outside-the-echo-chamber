So I've started reading the [Perl-Signals][1] tumblr feed which is organized / filtered by Jess Robinson (the DBIx::Class docs maven and all around excellent person to have filtering). Across the feed came [this][2] post about hooking a chatter bot up to a MUCK. I was chuffed to see that he's using Net::AIML! Rock on!
