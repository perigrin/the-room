So I've been reading alot of Philip K. Dick recently. Which is really interesting, because it was written just after WWII (early 50's mostly) and has a whole different take on what the future will be like. Nearly 90% of the stories I've read thus far have included some form of nuclear holocost that has decimated life as we know it. Computers have nearly no presence, although there was a swibble which was some form of bio-mechanical device that would fit in nearly exactly with modern bio-gentic tales of horror.

Then I came across this in an email:
<a title="Radebaugh: The Future We Were Promised" href="http://www.losthighways.org/radebaugh.html">Radebaugh: The Future We Were Promised</a>

It'd be interesting to really give a solid look at the history of the future some time. I really enjoy seeing the historical documentaries on where we'll all be in some far flung future time like the year 2000.
