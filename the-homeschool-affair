# The HomeSchool Affair
So this weekend Jamie and I spent two days at the FEPA (Florida Educator Parent Association) Annual convention. We are planning on trying to home school [Katie](http://kaitlynn.prather.org) for a year, and to see what comes of that. The highlight of the show was the [science booth](https://adwords.google.com/select/Login) where the lady was [blowing stuff up](http://www.superchargedscience.com/rocketry-trailer.wmv). (Aurora Lipper is officially one of the world's coolest people.)

All in all it was a good but tiring two days spent with some of the most religious people on the planet. Apparently 90% of the home school population in Florida is *very* Christian.
