# Trust issues...
Right with help from `Moe` I've updated Bender's nick recognition ... but I should move the regex into Bot::Pluggable::Common and have it exported. 

I've also (I think) sorted ChannelGuard so that it properly updates channels like it should. So when users join/part/quit it sets the channel limit appropriately.

I've also gotten envous of plog on #poe ... and I think I wanna write a blogging plugin for Bender next ... I'll probably use <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/ASCOPE/Net-Blogger-0.8.3/">Net::Blogger</a> to get there.
