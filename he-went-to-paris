My <a href="http://www.yapc.org/Europe">YAPC::EU</a> talk was accepted. I shall be speaking for 40 minutes on the Compiler I wrote for Soq. I have most of an outline written, but I need to polish it up and actually write the damn slides ... 

I'm thinking of going with xHTML generated from the ShadowXML files the slides are currently in. That way I theoretically could use Soq to edit the talk upto the last minute from anywhere in the world.
