# T-SQL is evil.
Maybe Rhonda can figure this out... it totally stumps me why it's not working. 

See inside for the goary details, but I spent an hour or so trying to figure it out or look up a reason on the net as to why it's failing.

Bonus points to whoever gives the best explanation why. (I've no clue)
