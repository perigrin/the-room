As promised, here's a picture of Zelda 
<img src="http://www.prather.org/images/zelda.jpg">

Which wasn't as easy to place into the page as it
could have been. Dragging n' Dropping didn't work,
I had to actually edit the source, and that set the
source of the image to the text of the next blog
entry. I didn't realize that at first and deleted
it. ::sigh::
Fotios (who's over for dinner) says to just log it.
