<blockquote>
<p>Skillet Corn Bread

<p>You Will Need:
<ul>
<li>2 cups Corn Meal
<li>1 egg (beaten)
<li>1 cup milk
<li>1/4 cup oil
<li>1 tablespoon sugar
</ul>
<p>To Prepare:
<p>Heat oven to 425 degrees. Grease the inside of your 8-inch cast iron skillet and place it in the oven. In a medium or large bowl, beat your egg and add milk and oil. Stir in sugar, then cornmeal, just until moistened. The batter should be lumpy - do not overmix. Carefully remove your skillet from the oven and pour in the batter. Return to oven. Bake for 20-30 minutes. The top of your cornbread should be golden-brown and a toothpick inserted in the center will come out clean when the bread is done. Serve warm.

This is currently in the oven baking, hopefully it will go well with the beans and rice for lunch tomorrow.

EDIT: As it's given here is a very ... let's say ... traditional ... corn bread. You might want to modify the receipe  a bit.
