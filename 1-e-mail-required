Title: 1 E-mail Required

I found a previous professor's new website tonight.
http://cla.calpoly.edu/~dgillett/
The neat thing about this is he's the professor I
went to, to get a letter of reccomendation from,
when I moved to the UK. I'm so tired at the moment
that I have screwed up three attempts to e-mail him
by putting the subject line into the CC field in
Squirrel mail. It's understandable because I use
Pegasus mail now at work and the fields are funky
in it.
Hopefully I can get an e-mail out to him tomorrow
with better success. He'll probablly complain that
my grammer and spelling have slid hideously, and
he'd be right.
