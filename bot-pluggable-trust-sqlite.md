# Bot::Pluggable::Trust::SQLite
It seems to be finished Yeah!! After a bit of testing I'll document it and release it to CPAN along with some of the other bot pluggable modules I've got running around.

Next to finish the FServ Bot ... as well as finish Apache::PPD and then start on Apache::Tidy ...  I'm quite happy with all of this if you cant tell.
