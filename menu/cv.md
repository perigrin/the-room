### Managing Partner — Tamarou
_September 2008 - Present - Orlando FL_

Tamarou is a consulting company specializing in primarily developing web
applications with a focus in Perl. We believe that the "miracles of ingenuity"
that come with advanced technology should be used to minimize the time spent in
unattractive labor, and that craftsman who take pleasure in their work produce
things that are pleasing to their customers.

We have worked with customers on migrating their antiquated applications to
modern  REST APIs leveraging Modern Perl's best practices, migrated systems to
use queue based infrastructures to promote scalability, and done systems
deployments and data center migrations for large  applications using Ansible.

### Module Author — CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network)
_April 2003 – Present_

I'm one of the core maintainers for Moose, mostly responsible for
`oose.pm` which allows you to write one-liners easier. In 2007 I created
`Task::Kensho` primarily to stop Matt Trout's whinging about a kitchen sink
included distribution for Perl. Worked with the current and original
maintainers of `Net::Twitter` during the re-design and port to Moose.

distribution.

startup.

### Development Team Programmer — HD Publishing Group
_September 2008 – August 2009 - Lake Mary FL_

I made significant changes to the order processing system, reducing code
duplication and adding more verification of user entered data. I added a system
to track updates to customer billing accounts and update our internal records
so that automatic re-billing would work seamlessly. I helped implement
integration with a third party verification system. I built an on-deman
reporting system to perform business intelligence queries for Marketting and
Upper Managment.

I researched developing a graph oriented data-store linking potentially
hundreds of millions of records based on latent semantic criteria.

Finally I introduced modern Perl frameworks such as Moose, and DBIx::Class into
the development process, and migrated the code source control system from
Subversion to Git. I assisted developers on getting up to speed with the new
systems and technology.

access to quality assurance tools for Real Time Composite Pricing. I helped

I built an application for real time TBA mortgage pricing, and designed several
other web based utilities for the Pricing Desk analysts to control the daily
pricing cycles.

95 Client and Peer Networking, Windows NT 4.0, as well as Novell 3.5x, 4.10,

## Reccomendations

### Marc Mims - Principal at Followerwonk
_October 7, 2016 - Marc managed Chris directly_

Chris Prather is someone you will want on your team. He is the master of many
skills, learns new skills quickly, and acts as a multiplier for team
effectiveness.

I met Chris through work on OSS projects and sought his recommendation when we
needed a full-time contractor for Followerwonk at Moz. To my surprise and good
fortune, Chris was available himself. We spent 4 years working together through
that relationship.

Chris is an extremely active member of the Perl community. He has organized and
hosted conferences, including YAPC::NA, the annual North American conference.
He knows, personally, many of the most active and respected authors and
maintainers in the Perl community. This is invaluable for a team using Perl.
While contracting for Moz, he facilitated many interactions with authors of
modules our product depended on, getting assistance with bugs (whether ours or
those in dependent modules), getting our patches for upstream dependencies
applied and released, and obtaining expert advice when we needed it.

Chris is an expert with many of the Perl's modern, active, projects. We
employed his extensive knowledge of Moose, DBIx::Class, and many modules he
authored himself, or contributed to.

Chris in a REST expert. He took the lead on all of our API design and
implementation initiatives.

I've worked daily with Chris for years, but seldom in person. He's a master of
remote communication and can work extremely well remotely.

If your are considering adding Chris to your team or project, I'd be happy to
answer any questions you have about his potential fit.

### Peter Li - Fullstack Developer / Project Manager
_September 12, 2016, Peter worked with Chris on the same project_

Professional, patient, knowledgeable. These are the words that comes to my mind
when I think of Chris and my time working with him. He was the contractor in
our team when I joined, however he integrates with the team, led many critical
architecture discussion, and most importantly has an open mind to participate
and improve the team both from a technical and personal standpoint. Working
with Chris was a pleasure, and he will be on the top of my list the next time I
need a full stack developer for my team.

### Breno G. de Oliveira — Co Founder at Colab55
_September 29, 2014, Breno reported to Chris at Tamarou_

Chris is a great manager, very practical and pragmatic when it comes to solving
the client's needs. He really knows how to shield the team in challenging
situations while still allowing them to take ownership of the projects and
responsibilities they were assigned with. His experience and impressive
technical skills let him effectively deal with potential issues before they
even arise

### Scott McWhirter — Senior Systems Engineer at nearForm
_December 8, 2008, Scott worked directly with Chris at CPAN_

Chris has always been a great source of ideas and I have a great respect for
the code that he produces. I have worked with him on several occasions with
Open Source projects on CPAN and a lot of his comments and suggestions have
shaped the work I have produced. I hope to work more with him in the future.

### Michael Nachbaur — Lead Member of Technical Staff at Salesforce.com
_January 25, 2007, Michael was with another company when working with Chris at CPAN_

I have known Chris for more than 5 years now as mutual developers on the same
Open Source software project, as well as socially. In this time, Chris has
proven himself to be reliable, both as a person as well as in his capacity as a
software developer. In this industry you tend to surround yourself by a network
of developers whose style, adherence to good practices and standards, and
personal ethic are compatible with your own. In this regard, Chris is not only
an excellent developer but also a good friend.

I would gladly work with Chris anywhere, and would hire him in an instant if I
were in a position to do so.

### Michael Boyko — Software Engineer at Clockwork Active Media
_January 22, 2008, Michael worked directly with Chris at Reuters_

Chris knows more about Perl than anyone else that I know. He is very well
versed in what CPAN has and has contributed to it on multiple occasions. If you
are looking for a Perl programmer then Chris should be considered for the job.

### Laura Intably — Owner at iQ Beauty
_March 13, 2007, Laura was Chris's client_

Chris's technical knowledge, creativity and integrity are of the highest
level,. He is an extemely experienced software developer with a knack for
problem solving.

### Alex Fotios — CEO, CTO at Domino Enterprises
_February 15, 2007, Alex worked directly with Chris at NKD Webmedia_

I have worked with Chris in the same group for more than a year and I can
safely say that he is a very talented and dedicated developer that would make a
great asset to any software development effort. On top of that he is a very
good team player and above all a nice person that can be trusted.
