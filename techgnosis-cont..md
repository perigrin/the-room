# Techgnosis Cont.
Read some more of Techgnosis last night, and it was
talkng about a Gnostic text (big G so you know it's
authentic) called the "Hymn of the Pearl" which
according to Erik Davis shows an example of pure
information (the letter from the prince's parents)
exterting control over reality (waking the prince
from his stupor). Again very similar to another
Cyberpunk classic Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson
